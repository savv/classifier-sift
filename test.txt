__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Credit Trading - Approval Form ;;;   I think that the "general policies" route is the right (and only) one -  particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged.  From a  legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all  clear, provided in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty  of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc).   We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not  per se a legal task) in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal  due diligence in its country of establishment/location in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal  due diligence in its country of establishment/location  Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in  the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as  generically as possible.    Hope this gives a sense of where we're coming from.  Please call me to  discuss further if need be.  Paul     Tomas Valnek 22/05/2000 10:44

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Emissions ;;;   Larry,  I am attaching a graph that shows how the CO emissions increase exponentially (vppm) as the turbine operating power is lowered.  The 50% base load CO levels are between 215 and 250 vppm.  This graph also shows a wider ambient temperature range.  As stated on the phone today the 45 vppm NOx levels are achievable across the entire operating range.  I apologize for the SI units on the graph, but I ran out of time to convert  the chart to imperial units, but hopefully it helps for you to understand the concept.  Call me at home this weekend, if you need anything.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: WSJ Article on Enron/Portland General Sale to Northwest Natural ;;;   Northwest Natural In Talks With Enron Over Portland Utility  By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Robin Sidel, Rebecca Smith and Nikhil Deogun 10/05/2001   The Wall Street Journal B2 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Enron Corp. is in advanced discussions to sell its Portland General Electric utility unit to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for about $1.8 billion in cash and stock in a highly leveraged transaction that would eventually give Enron a minority stake in Northwest, according to people familiar with the matter.  The discussions are at a very delicate stage, and some important points need to be finalized, these people caution. The current environment could also make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn't a certainty. However, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could be announced in the next few days. Northwest Natural is also expected to assume roughly $1 billion in debt.  Enron and Northwest Natural declined to comment.  If a transaction is consummated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enron's agreement to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources. That transaction fell apart in part because of the California energy crisis.  A purchase of Portland General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural, which has a market capitalization of just $650 million and supplies natural gas to more than 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Wash. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million customers in Oregon.  The deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whose executives and employees know each other well. Richard G. Reiten, Northwest's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating officer of Portland General between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board.  By buying a utility, Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when prices are cheap. A deal would be accretive to Northwest's earnings, people familiar with the matter say. And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is somewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transaction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in Northwest Natural in addition to cash. Northwest Natural would finance the transaction with debt and equity offerings.  Shares of Northwest Natural were trading up $1.04 at $25.99 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $33.10.  For Enron, a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a five-year ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break into California's deregulating electricity market. But the utility business proved less valuable than anticipated when Enron was prevented from selling off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply. And California's market developed serious problems last year that made it a less attractive place for Enron to do business.  Enron, which also owns a major gas-transmission pipeline system, has a history of buying assets and businesses, learning what it can from them, and then selling off the bulk of physical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere.  It isn't clear where Enron will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale. Its broadband telecommunications business is in the doldrums and it recently said it would invest $250 million in it this year, down from a formerly projected $750 million.

On the agenda for the next week are two important items - (1) the Mayor's  February 1 news conference announcing the Houston Fire Chief selection  committee and its members; and (2) coordination of an action plan, which we  should work out prior to the news conference.  News Conference specifics: speakers - Mayor Brown and Jeff Skilling in attendance - all selection committee members location - Fire Station #6, 3402 Washington Ave. date - Thursday, February 1, 2001 time - 2pm duration - approximately 30 minutes  I'd like to emphasize that it would be ideal if all selection committee  members were present at the news conference.   I will need bios on each committee member emailed to me by close of business  Monday, January 29, 2001. These bios will be attached to a press release the  Mayor's Office is compiling.  Coordination of action plan: Since we have only 1 week between now and the news conference, Jeff has  proposed that he take a stab at putting together an initial draft. He will  then email to all committee members for comments/suggestions and make changes  accordingly. Hope this works for everyone - if not, give me a call  (713)-345-4840.  Thanks, Lisa

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Savings Plan v. 401K ;;;   Kate -   401K and the cash balance retirement plan are 2 separate plans.  You are  automatically enrolled in the cash balance plan - you would be eligible to  participate for the year 2000.  Going forward, at the end of each year, Enron  will set aside 5% of your salary into an account (Enron directs these  funds).  This account has a 5 year vesting period meaning that you must stay  with the company for 5 years to be eligible to receive these funds when you  leave.   Does this help?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Compression Services Agreement Calculation ;;;   Tony,  The following steps follow the contract amendment (assumes Bloomfield  contract):  1.  Calculate the number of hours that the driver was down for force majeure. 2.  Subtract the hours in #1 from the total hours in the month. 3.  Calculate the Monthly Contract Quantity as defined in the amendment  (Bloomfield -- 7000 times # of hours developed in #2 above) 4.  Calculate the Load Factor as defined in the agreement.  Since we don't have a load factor during those hours of the Force Majeure  Event, we assume that the unit would have run at the load factor in #4 above  if not for the Force Majeure event.  Thus,   5.  Multiply the Load Factor times 7000 (max HP-hrs) times # of hours of  force majeure event.  This gives you the equivalent HP-hours that would have  been used during the Force Majeure event or Supply Interruption. 6.  In accordance with the amended Section 3.2(a), to calculate HP-hour  charge do the following:   Multiply Conversion Factor (taken from Exhibit based on load factor) times  (Shaft Energy delivered + Equivalent   HP-hours during Force Majeure [this is  the number calculated in #5 above]) times 1.031.  Let me know if you have any questions.  We can work through an example if we  need to.  Thanks.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Employee issues ;;;   Corporate comp is relooking at your contract based on our converstion..ieyou  would be entitled to severance payment eqyual to 2 year salary and bonus  should you decide to leave the company provided that all or substantially all  of the Azurix assts other than ?Wessex and Azurix Bu7enos Aires are sold.  I will meet with Jim Derrick today to discuss John Ale.  With regard to Beckett and Glasford; their agreements provide for retention  bonuses provided they stay until September 16th.  If they voluntarily leave  before that they get nothing.  There is no employment agreements in place  that link anything to comparable positions titles or anything else.  Should  we move them over to Enron in Director positions and they are subsequently  offerred positions elsewhere in Enron ( once we dispose of non-Wessex and ABA  assets) at Director positions, then they have a choice of  accepting those  positions or voluntarily terminating.  Since there is no contractual  agreements with these two I do not want to offer any kind of enhanced  severance payments to them.  I have contacted Ben Glisan regarding Glasford  and he is polling his people about their view on an appropiate placement for  him.  I will talk with you when you return.  Thanks.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: A few more questions ;;;   Rick --   1.  We are adding the following paragraph to the exit letters for the group.   Outplacement Services Enron has contracted with Spherion, a leader in outplacement consulting and career transition with 51 offices nationwide.  The Career Transition Program includes the utilization of Spherion's Career Planning Model Methodology which encompasses the completion of a career analysis, broadcast letters and resume, interview training and the development of an individual marketing plan.  A career consultant is assigned to work with the candidate for the duration of the program.  Candidates may also attend on-going sessions for Internet training, library research tips, financial planning and other career-related topics.  Individualized job search coaching and consultation are also provided.  If you have an interest in participating in this program, please notify me and I will make arrangements for a Spherion consultant to contact you.  The program may be initiated as soon as possible, but no later than one month after your termination date.  The program for administrative staff is a 1-month program @ $3,000 -- the program for the professional staff is a 3-month program @ $5,000. QUESTION 1:  Do I add this to Bessie Hiler's package? QUESTION 2:  Donna Fulton has already been working with an independent career planning consultant and would like to continue.  Can she just invoice us (up to $5,000) and continue to use her?  (I've not indicated to her an amount)   I'm OK with it if you are. QUESTION 3:  Do you want these costs accrued this year as well?  2.  Is it OK to send Bessie her package?  I'll have them all complete and ready to overnight tomorrow so they will have in their hands by Monday.  3.  Vacation payouts won't be paid until 1/15/02 for everyone except Lisa.  Do you want these costs accrued this year as well?  Thanks for your help.  Looks like we'll get this pretty well wrapped up tomorrow.  I'll keep you posted. Jo Ann

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RTO advocacy update ;;;   The RTO advocacy effort is off to a good start.  As you recall, I sent out a request for information last week to a few of you in the field asking for the following:  a summary of the stakeholders who are raising concerns with the FERC RTO model an outline of their arguments/criticisms/concerns, and  a list of priority issues that need addressing  The feedback was tremendous, and it included useful comments in regard to how we might better improve the delivery of our RTO message.   Due to the increasing concerns and waivering support among Members of Congress, Governors, state utility commissions, legislators and other stakeholder groups in regard to the FERC RTO model it is imperative that we develop a sound strategy and strong arguments around the RTO issue.     Toward that end, I have summarized your comments and am coordinating with our friends at Tabors Caramanis and Frontier Economics on the development of materials that can be used in your upcoming meetings with stakeholders.     The first set of documents will address the following issues:  A side-by-side graphic of the FERC RTO model v. the utility 17+ RTOs accompanied by an explanation of power flows that builds on Tabors Caramanis work on natural markets which support the FERC model. Reliability Document - this document will start with a brief history of the NY blackouts, the state's inability to deal with reliability and how and why the federal government became involved, the role of NERC.  The synopsis will finally address the red herrings associated with reliability issues and the benefits to reliability as a result of implementing the FERC model.  It will also briefly address control issues for states and real-time reliability. Economics - This summary will show examples of historical cost savings of aggregation; it will highlight cost savings potential, and also identify peculiar left-over costs of how certain systems grew and the costs were never eradicated. The Hit List - This document will address issues such as environmental arguments; eminent domain; implementation issues; cost shifts to people during transitions; infrastructure/software concerns; and other issues that are raised as a reasons not to implment the FERC RTO. The well-designed RTO - Using specific analogies we will outline how other similar interstate issues work (the short-term and long-term issues to planning); reasons to avoid balkanization; and we will identify the key elements of a well-designed RTO. Governance Issues - Here we will address the issue of independent boards not beholden to commission interests; we'll show how the state isn't really losing control that in fact there will be a diminished role for commissions and legislators; we'll attempt to distinguish between regional led organizations v institutional (using water issues/planning in the Northwest as an example; We'll draw from history and look at NE and PJM and how organizations like NECPUC were formed.  Environmental Issues - We're first going to develop an outline to see whether a document is necessary.  But some of the issues to be addressed are air quality benefits and NIMBY issues.  Understand that the above is a simplified and very narrow list of issues.  It is not an exhaustive list of what we need to address - it's only a start based on your comments.     I will coordinate with TC and FE on timeframe for delivery, but I am expecting a draft set of documents by September 7th.   I will identify approximately 5 people from our RTO Team to review the draft documents and weigh in with comments.  I will provide everyone with a set of final documents by mid-September.   *************************************************** AS PART OF OUR RTO ADVOCACY EFFORT, I WILL BE ASSIGNING WEEKLY DELIVERABLES TO PEOPLE.  PLEASE KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THESE EMAILS - THEY WILL USUALLY BE SENT OUT ON FRIDAY MORNINGS AND DUE THE FOLLOWING MONDAY.

I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to  ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information  required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were  expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a  September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that  energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I  phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept  aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls,  both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we  approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were  conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional  time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else  could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure  that the permits would be issued in a timely manner.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Special Bulletin -- Reason Fdn work on electricity and Ken Lay ;;;   Price caps will not solve the problem 	 	By Adrian Moore and Lynn Kiesling  	April 19, 2001  	The drumbeat is again sounding for a return to wholesale price caps in  California's electricity market. While well intentioned, such a move would be  a grave mistake.  	Price controls have a history of distorting markets where competitive prices  are possible, leading to shortages of supply, inadequate investment,  over-consumption, and a myriad of other problems. In the case of California's  electricity crunch, a return to price caps would only increase the threat of  blackouts, as the supply of electricity would not keep pace with California's  appetite for power. Unfortunately, state leaders pushing for price caps  ignore history's lessons and seem destined to repeat past mistakes.  	California already experimented with price caps and it was a dismal failure.  As California's wholesale power prices rose rapidly in the spring of 2000,  the state Independent System Operator (ISO) quickly imposed a price cap. As a  result, the amount of power supplied to the state decreased as suppliers  pursued more lucrative opportunities elsewhere, selling their power in states  without price caps. In fact, imported electricity declined 33 percent in 2000  from the previous year.  	Consumer prices in two-thirds of the state were not affected and consumers  did not reduce demand. Scarcity turned into outright shortages. ISO staffers  spent much of their time rounding up power to keep the lights on hour by hour  rather than tending to the needs of the grid. As supplies continued to fall,  the ISO eventually lifted the caps to avert blackouts.  	When a similar situation occurred across the Midwest in 1998, policy-makers  pursued a dramatically different course which resulted in a dramatically  different outcome. Policy-makers let market prices rise to attract both power  and investment to the region, and now new power plants are being built.  	So, if price caps are not the solution, what is?  	California must choose between two directions for its electricity market to  move out of its current dysfunctional state: a state takeover of the market,  which is the direction Gov. Gray Davis' policies are leading, or a transition  to a deregulated market with real choices for customers. Given the success of  deregulating electricity generation in states like Pennsylvania and Texas,  California should pursue the latter course. But the transition will not be  easy.  	First and foremost, California must articulate a vision of moving toward  competition that will encourage new suppliers to enter the market. Too many  state leaders are offering isolated policy ideas and conflicting proposals  that do not inform the market in what direction policy is moving and what end  state is sought. In other cases, the state is hanging a "business not  welcome" sign on the door by scaring off would-be suppliers with high-pitched  rhetoric and threats of state takeovers.  	Once a clear vision is laid out, California will need to move toward a system  where consumers pay market prices for electricity, as this is the only way to  ensure that demand does not outpace supply. But this move will inevitably  cause some transition pains. Laying out a clear plan for this transition will  make it easier for the public to deal with.  	The state also can encourage utilities to implement real-time pricing and  metering so consumers can adjust their use of electricity as prices change.  Again, by providing more information, customers are better able to manage  this transition.  	But the state should ensure that utilities do not simply pass all of their  previous losses onto consumers through increased prices. The utilities helped  contribute to the problem and must shoulder some of the costs.  	Finally, if the state is going to move to a truly competitive market,  utilities must be free to purchase power competitively. Rather than trying to  oversee every transaction through a central pool, the state should encourage  a voluntary, independent competitive exchange and develop bidding rules that  attract both buyers and sellers, and enable utilities to purchase long-term  contracts at lower prices.  	Granted, the electricity crisis is no simple problem that the state can solve  with the stroke of a pen or public speech about the need for conservation.  Without a doubt, it is going to cause some pain.  	But beyond the short-term difficulties,? California can still emerge? with a  robust,? reliable power supply? that encourages new investment,? empowers  consumers to choose? providers of their choice,? and lowers the cost of the  fuel? our state's high-tech economy runs on.? A return to price caps? would  all but eliminate? that prospect and shatter California's track record? as a  forward-looking source of new ideas.

Kiesling is director of economic  policy at the Reason Public Policy Institute and visiting associate professor  of economics at Northwestern University. Her e-mail address is  lynnek@rppi.org.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: November 9 FERC Comments ;;;     Gang,    I didn't get Jim's e-mail but .....  Here are my comments    This looks good as a bottomline message, but I'd like to dress it up and take   it out on a date first (doesn't dasovich talk like this?)    I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of   the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers   to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.  there is some   stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.  we also have   some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally   really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on   demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS   this summer.  To the contrary, in the west, we were working with some   customers (a  few hundred MWs)  to participate in the ISO's program -- after   the Board voted to lower the cap to $250 -- the customers all said sayonara   -- could no longer justify the expense and the interference in their   operations.  These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail   demand response.    This only goes so far, however...    The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids   from the price caps.  SO, we need more...    I think we should focus on the practical effects of a "soft" cap (not simple   and not certain) -- and how stable markets need stable price caps -- "soft"   caps are not a stable price and do not send a stable signal for investment in   new generation (the market may never know the real price since it doesn't set   the MCP). The staff report provides some good evidence on why the caps are   too low and we could also use the ISO's calculation of prices for short-term   peaking capacity.  Then mention the issues Mary discussed below (information;   cap mechanism bad for power marketers in particular)    Sue        	Mary Hain@ECT  	11/02/2000 01:03 PM  		   		 To: Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@Enron, Mona L Petrochko/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff   Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT,   Dave Parquet, Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT  		 cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe Hartsoe@Enron, Sarah   Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, carrrn@bracepatt.com, Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON  		 Subject: November 9 FERC Comments    In response to Jim's E-mail  - here's is my proposed list of issues for   Enron's November 9 comments.  We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow   so please comment on this ASAP.    We should discuss price signals including:  price caps and  market information    Here's my rationale.  Since we'll only have five to ten minutes to talk, our   comments should focus on the most important commercial issues to us: removing   or improving price caps and improving market transparency by providing market   information to market participants.  We could summarize the positions we took   in the white paper about why the Commission shouldn't allow a price cap at   all and why we need information.  In addition, we should assume that they   will adopt price caps anyway and may reaffirm their own proposal, so we   should also tell them how the $150 cap will be too low to incent investment   in new generation, how the reporting requirement will create special problems   for power marketers  (we don't have marginal costs and the Commission has yet   to determine what opportunity costs are), and how they still have not   addressed the problems created by OOM.    In addition, although I don't think we need to tell FERC this, our comments   could briefly congratulate the Commission for removing the buy/sell   requirement, addressing underscheduling of load, creating independent   governance and directing the ISO to file generation interconnection   procedures.  Although our written comments will probably want to discuss any   clarifications of this measures as well as the long term measures the   Commission discussed (reserve requirements, alternate auction mechanisms,   balanced schedules, enhanced market mitigation, congestion management   redesign, demand response programs, RTO development and compliance) our oral   comment time is too precious to use on these issues.  In addition, our   written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's   conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's   decision to move the refund effective date.  I'm sure we'll find more issues   as we go.

The remaining  50.1 percent of Sithe will be owned by Vivendi (34 percent), Marubeni Corp.  (15 percent) and Sithe Management (1 percent). Vivendi Universal retains  a blocking minority interest of 34 percent in the company and PECO Energy  (which, along with Unicom, formed Exelon Corp.) becomes Sithe's main  shareholder.  PECO has also been given a three-year commitment starting from December  2002, to buy Vivendi Universal's remaining interest.   ANALYSIS: The announcement of this acquisition was first made in August,  prior to the formation of Exelon Corp. Under the original agreement dated  Aug. 11, 2000, PECO Energy is purchasing 49.9 percent of Sithe's North  American assets, including its domestic marketing and development businesses,  for $682 million. The acquisition marks a new direction for Sithe Energies  and a continuation of an aggressive generation expansion plan on the part  of Exelon.   This divestiture by Sithe Energies signals its withdrawal from power  production.  Only two years ago, Sithe Energies was one of the largest independent power  producers in the United States, operating 43 power plants from New Jersey  to California. Sithe Energies had made a decided effort to purchase vast  generation assets in the Northeastern United States, believing that there  would be value in having critical mass in the deregulated generation market  in that region. Until last year, Sithe Energies was the primary subsidiary  of French mega-utility Vivendi, which had been creating a reputation as  an industry powerhouse due to its assets in electric energy services, thermal  energy supply, water distribution and wastewater management. Interestingly,  Vivendi did not own a gas or electric utility anywhere in the world, and  instead used Sithe Energies as the vehicle to accumulate generation assets  as its primary entry into the energy industry.   Indications that the company's strategy was changing began to surface earlier  this year. In February, Sithe Energies sold 21 power plants to Reliant  Energy for a total of $2.1 billion. The sale generated an immediate capital  gain of about $450 million for Sithe Energies, indicating that its generation  assets were bringing strong shareholder value for its investors, even if  the company appeared to be exiting the generation market.  Then, in June, Vivendi announced that it had entered into a "strategic  business combination" with Canal and The Seagram Company Ltd to form a  new company called Vivendi Universal, a communications conglomerate for  wired and wireless markets owning the world's largest music company, second  largest film library, major film production studio, and a PC-based software  game publishing company. (Note that just yesterday Vivendi Universal entered  into an agreement for the sale of Seagram's spirits and wine business to  Diageo and Pernod Ricard for $8.1 billion, subject to regulatory approvals).  Vivendi also continued to expand its significant water business, through  its subsidiaries U.S. Filter Corporation and G,n,rale des Eaux Group which  recently won water treatment contracts New Zealand and Indonesia. In a  separate development, Vivendi, supported by Sithe Energies, developed a  partnership with a company named Softbank to establish a unit called K  Road Ventures. This company represented Vivendi's strategy of creating  an Internet company specializing in B-to-B services for utilities and energy  services.  All of these developments indicated that, although Vivendi planned to remain  involved in the energy industry, its focus was no longer on building a  generation portfolio through Sithe Energies. Rather, Vivendi is building  on its role as a major player in communications and environmental services.  The subtext of this new direction for the company is probably Vivendi's  attempt to reduce the debt of its subsidiaries to a reported 11 billion  euros by the end of this year. Yet, most financial analysts agree that  the continuing divestiture of Sithe Energies marks Vivendi's complete  withdrawal  from the energy production business. Vivendi has been in the process of  spinning off a new utilities arm named Vivendi Environnment, which will  provide energy services such as equipment installation and maintenance,  as well as water and wastewater treatment. The K Road Ventures unit probably  will be operated within Vivendi Environnment; however, it appears fairly  certain that generation is no longer a part of the company's primary strategy.  According to Vivendi, this divestiture confirms the exit of Sithe North  America from the consolidation scope of Vivendi Universal. Including the  divestiture of GPU, which took place at the beginning of the year, the  transactions represent a total debt reduction of around 4 billion euros  and a net capital gain of 170 million euros in the financial statements  for 2000.  Presently across North America, Sithe Energies still owns and operates  about 27 power generation plants with approximately 3,800 MW of net merchant  generating capacity. Further divestiture of these assets is expected as  Sithe and Vivendi continue to move away from power generation. PECO (now  Exelon) and Reliant are two companies that have quickly picked up the  generation  assets divested by Sithe Energies, and has been a wise move for both  companies.  There should be a continuing high value placed on generation assets in  the Northeastern United States, particularly since competitive markets  are developing more rapidly in that region of the country. Reliant's purchase  of the Sithe Energies' 21 plants supports its strategy of acquiring  generation  assets and developing a strong retail capability.   Purchasing 49.9 percent of Sithe Energies, with the option to buy the rest  of the company in as little as two years, is also a smart move for Exelon.  The Power Generation Group (PGG) of PECO, which remains a subsidiary under  the new Exelon holding company, is the business unit responsible for managing  the fossil and hydro generating stations of the company. PGG manages a  fleet of 72 generating units that can provide 5200 megawatts (MW) of power  using a variety of fuels. These units include coal, natural gas, oil,  landfill  gas, and hydroelectric power plants. Under deregulation, this variety of  fuels is helping PECO to remain competitive and prepared to meeting the  energy needs of diverse customers. Presently, Exelon is the largest energy  company in the United States, but will trumped by the Entergy/FPL Group  combination, which is expected to close over the next year.   The addition to Exelon's generation arsenal that it gains from almost half  the shares of Sithe Energies should factor in nicely to Exelon's overall  position in the industry. Exelon estimates that the initial investment  in Sithe will contribute approximately $0.01 per share to its consolidated  earnings in 2001 and 2002. And it certainly appears that Exelon aims to  acquire the totality of Sithe's assets, based on comments coming out of  the company's headquarters. If Exelon were to purchase the remaining 50.1  percent of Sithe (as soon as two years from now), Exelon anticipates that  the transaction would contribute approximately $0.15 to its annual  consolidated  earnings. This may be just the move that Exelon has in mind as a complete  acquisition of Sithe's assets would increase Exelon's generation portfolio  to 46,500 MW, which is perhaps just what it needs to secure its place as  one of the nation's top generating companies and keep it in the running  with FPL / Entergy. =============================================================== SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free, daily IssueAlert.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Call ;;;   Hi Louise,  welcome back!   I trust everything is OK at home? How are you coping?  My assistant told me that you tried to call me........what's the subject?,  general catch-up?, want to know what Zhiyong wants to see you for, pick up where we left off?  I imagine you must also be VERY busy, so soon after your return to work...so here's a start..............  ....where we left off... Just before you left, I tried to get to see you to discuss the whole consolidation of Gas systems issue. We've been working through something called  Gas Trading Vision 2, which in my mind wasn't really a "vision", but more of a series of "fixes" to the exisitng systems.  I had got some overview flow diagrams completed for all the Gas Systems, and after asking lots of questions about how these systems evolved, started drawing some conclusions about why we appear to be in such a state. Apart from the obvious overlap of our several Gas systems, it occured to me that our huge team size had quite a lot to do with sheer number of technologies employed as well as the the sheer number of moving inter-related parts. For each technology employed, that skill set has to be present in the team supporting it, and most of the time these guys are not mult-skilled, so we end up with lots of individual skill sets that can't be transfered easily.  What I wanted to propose, was a serious, incremental effort, to consolidate the systems and to decommission the old ones as we went along. This would free up resources, and with a smaller technology set make them more responsive and flexible so they could be used to add value.  Note: This is not a Sitara 2, not big bang.... this is an incremental approach....  While you've been gone, we've been getting together to discuss this, (a lot harder than expected!), and have started to make a stab at identifying the component pieces, technology choices, biggest commercial impact etc....and have some pre-liminary direction.  Is this something you would back?.... or am I wasting my time?   (before you write this off completely, I would like the opportunity of talking to you about it  Zhiyong Wei... He is probably going to ask you where you stand on project initiatives like the one above, as well as ask you what your overall vision is for the Gas Trading systems.  regards  Steve

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Synopsis Article: Notes on FERC's Conference on Competitive Natural Gas Markets ;;;   Olympian Status for U.S. Gas Market   Just so you'll know: "The natural gas market is a real success story. ...FERC  has gotten an enormous amount of things right. The market may not be  unblemished, but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best  market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across  dozens of products. It's something everyone should be proud of," Robert Levin  of the New York Mercantile Exchange told a FERC conference yesterday.   "The natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of  market conditions with hundreds, if not thousands of market participants,  using an extraordinary selection of market instruments," Levin continued,  adding that the Commission should be supporting the "growth and increased  sophistication of commerce. You're at that point now."   Warning against so-called solutions offered by some at the day-long  conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the  electric market, Levin cautioned, "liquidity cannot be legislated. Don't  overreact. The electric market is poorly regulated. Remedies from the natural  gas market should be transferred to the electric market, rather than allow  the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric  market.   "Rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas, change  the electric market," which Levin believes has developed its over-emphasis on  the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market.   But while Levin warned against too much market meddling, others among the  more than 30 representatives of the industry and its customers testifying at  FERC's conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of  initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline  transportation.   Eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, promoting expansion of the  existing pipeline infrastructure (especially in the Northeast), doing away  with straight-fix-variable (SFV) rate design, review of firm-to-wellhead  rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs  between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered  by mostly pipeline customers.   However, greater gas market liquidity shouldn't be confused with increased  competition in pipeline transportation, municipals and producers told FERC  staff during a post-Order 637 technical conference Wednesday. "...[W]e're  concerned the Commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in  pipeline transportation. The two are not the same," said Arthur Corbin on  behalf of the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents  municipal gas distributors.   "Even with greater and greater market liquidity, monopoly power exists in  [the] pipeline transportation segment. Captive shippers will always require a  regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate," he said.   Much the same holds true for LDCs, noted Bruce Henning, director of energy  practices for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc. (EEA), who represented  the American Gas Association (AGA) at the Commission staff conference. He  agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably, but he added "there's not  a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location.  Nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the  near future..." Consequently, Henning said FERC will need to continue to  protect producers from market power that accompanies "limited access" to  pipelines.   The day-long conference held yesterday in Washington D.C. was the first of  several that FERC staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the  Commission's transportation policies on the development of gas markets.   Christopher A. Helms, president and COO of Panhandle Pipeline Companies,  urged FERC not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market  liquidity as the "ultimate goal" at the expense of the transportation market.  Helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and  construction of "optimal amounts of additional capacity" to meet the needs of  the market. "The single most important characteristic for liquidity in the  natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation  capacity."   Charles Daverio, vice president of KeySpan Corp., echoed that sentiment,  saying FERC could increase liquidity in the New York City market and  elsewhere in the Northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity  to ensure adequate supplies for the region year-round. This would reduce  energy costs and enhance reliability, he noted.   Panhandle's Helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the  development of new market centers and hubs. Market centers should be allowed  to develop at their "own pace," and at locations where the market "sees fit,"  he said.   EEA's Henning estimated more than 40 "liquid and transparent" market centers  exist today, which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily  under "extremely competitive" conditions. He said he's "confident" more will  be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers. As  another way to enhance liquidity, KeySpan's Daverio --- as well as others ---  supported eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, which requires the  customer to retain title to the gas while it's being shipped. Doing away with  the rule would pave the way for the development of new pipeline products and  services, such as operational balancing and virtual storage, he told the FERC  staff.   But Dena Wiggins, an attorney with the D.C. law firm of Sutherland, Asbill &  Brennan LLP, which represents the Process Gas Consumers Group (industrial gas  customers), said her group was "very concerned" about efforts to repeal the  rule. "...I haven't heard anything yet [today] that satisfies the concerns  that we might have." She noted the Commission already has granted exceptions  to the shipper-must-have-title rule in certain cases, and should continue  with this policy where necessary.   Moreover, Wiggins said industrial customers were increasingly worried about  the mounting market power of unregulated companies, especially gas marketers.   At the conference, she also expressed her group's dismay with the pipeline  compliance filings with Order 637, particularly on the penalty issue. Rather  than an "improved" penalty structure, pipelines are proposing higher  penalties, Wiggins said. "[We] continue to be shocked at the absolute  wholesale departures" from 637.   BP's Jeff Holligan also waded into the fight against all the new services  outlined by pipelines in their Order 637 filings, which he said were "nothing  more than penalties disguised as balancing services that customers can't  refuse." He urged the Commission to check with a pipeline's customers, noting  one proposed new "service" is opposed by 100% of the pipeline's  non-affiliated customers. Some of the proposed services, Holligan said, add  up to nothing more than degradation of existing long-term firm service.   Holligan, representing the largest producer in the U.S. and Canada, joined  other market participants in urging adoption of "standardized allocation  (sales), standardized penalty levels, and the requirement that all pipelines  implement a uniform title transfer tracking process." In short,  "standardizing pipeline services, certainly on an individual pipeline, and  also to a large extent between and across pipelines is imperative if markets  are to be highly liquid..Individually negotiated services, where every  service is a different service, or the adoption of a so-called dual track  market, are the antithesis of a highly liquid, efficient and competitive gas  market. Standardization of operational terms of pipeline service is necessary  to facilitate trading through e-commerce."   "The Commission should be striving to commoditize pipeline capacity so it can  be traded along with gas electronically," Holligan said.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Status, Redrock Air Permits ;;;   Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting  activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.  Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and  has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the  permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e  mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete,  but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to  the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15  and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ  plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in  Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx.  30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council  Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no  responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process,  they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring  sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel  monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them  otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer  for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also  an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions  from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.  Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for  the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also  approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There  are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment  period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it  will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on  the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this  date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for  station 3 and or 4.  Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: My model for spikes ;;;   Dear Dr. Kaminski,  I was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis the first of the preprints that I recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power. In this regard, I have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research and the Institute for Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be interested in receiving this preprint.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sincerely yours,  Valery Kholodnyi Manager of Quantitative Analysis Research and Analytics Group TXU Energy Trading  PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power:  1. Valery A. Kholodnyi, The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes  and Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00,  July 2000. 2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000. 3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000. 4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at  Two Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000. 5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000.  As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the absence of spikes.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Advertising Campaign - NASCAR ;;;   Dear Kelly:  I appreciate your comments regarding Enron's advertising focus.  First, Enron  become involved  with Enron Field for two reasons:  to keep the Astros in  Houston and to gain energy and facilities management business for Enron  Energy Services.  Acquiring the naming rights to the stadium came much later  in our negotiations with the Astros.  In addition, while sports events like  NASCAR are exciting to watch and get a fair amount of media play,  we're  targeting a more specific audience with our advertising dollars.    Increasingly, Enron,s integrated products and services require the approval  of an organization,s highest ranking officers, people who carry a &CXO8  title, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief  information officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not  recognize Enron,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric executives.  We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy and  regulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The "Ask Why" advertising  campaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in  mind as well as to put the Enron name and image on everyone,s radar screen.  Enron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and  CNNfn, as well as the History Channel, ESPN and network news programs. Some  are running in Europe as well.  While we won't rule out entirely the possibility of directing some of our  future advertising dollars toward sports events, for now, we believe we are  spending our ad budget where it will have the greatest positive impact on our  business.  Thanks for your suggestion.  Keep them coming.  Ken       Kelly Merritt@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/03/2000 04:20 PM

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Additional Soil Investigations, North Coles Levee ;;;   After reveiwing the documents entitled, "Baseline Environmental Investigation  of Arco North Coles Levee Plant 8, Rogas Loading Facility and Associated  Natural Gas Pipeline Systems Kern County, California" and "Report of  Preliminary Asessment Sampling North Coles Levee Gas Plant Loading Rack Area  Tupman, California", it appears that the following areas should be  investigated further to detemine horizontal and vertical extent of   identified contamination from the above referenced reports:   Tank 15 area-  total petroleum hydrocarbons   Glycol reboiler area- total petroleum hydrocarbons   Hot oil heater area- total petroleum hydrocarbons     Wash rack area- lead   Propane comp. area lead       total petroleum hydrocarbons     chromates   Cooling tower area- chromates   Compressor area- BTEX     chromates     lead  In the "Baseline Environmental Investigation" report, sampling was only  conducted to an approximate depth of 2.5'.  I am not comfortable with basing  decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the  fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move  vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.  This  is indeed the case for chromates.  I based my recommendations for metal  concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels  for metals and evaluated  the TPH and BTEX levels with the  underground  storage tank guidlines for California.  There were references to a 1989  document in the "Baseline" report for specific parameters, but there may have  been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and  therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states  for total petroleum hydrocarbons.  Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or  the loading rack issues.  One last issue.  As you know, identification of contamination is usually  accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination, knowledge of  processes and or history.  Report results of the surface contamination do not  show there to be an immediate environmental concern.  Due to the age of the  facility, there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports.   However, based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were  conducted throughout the facility, it appears that the information presented  in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the  facility.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Contract Exchange ;;;   I think we are on the right track from our meeting yesterday.

My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to  how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over  different scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.  We  can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.  I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I did  not want to forget them.    1.  When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how  will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.    2.  Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes  at a late time?  We could do the rest over the phone.  3.  On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it  would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30.    I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.  I'm sure  there are a lot of others.  Thanks.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FW: Demand Buy-Down ;;;   DWR now has authorization to buy down load at market prices.      Press Release      OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR  PR01: 285 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 06/10/2001     GOVERNOR DAVIS ORDERS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES WHO CUT ENERGY USE   Order Calls for Streamlining of Energy Demand Reduction Plans   LOS ANGELES   Governor Gray Davis today signed Executive Order D-39-01, which authorizes  the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to implement voluntary,  emergency load curtailment programs for commercial, industrial or other large  businesses. In exchange for agreeing to reduce electricity usage during power  emergencies, the DWR will offer financial incentives to participating  customers.   "Nearly 70 percent of energy usage in California is commercial," Governor  Davis said. "Commercial load curtailment programs can help mitigate and even  avoid blackouts. Therefore, I am ordering the Department of Water Resources  to implement a program that allows businesses to receive compensation if they  voluntarily agree to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods."  The Governor's order addresses the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent  load curtailment programs currently offered by the California Independent  System Operator, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Investor-Owned  Utilities.   The DWR and the ISO will implement the programs for Summer 2001 and Summer  2002 and the DWR will finance the customer incentives. The incentives will be  determined by a number of factors, including the size of the customer and the  amount of energy to be curtailed. The overall cost for the program, estimated  to be between $50-100 million, will ultimately depend on the number of  customers who sign up.       Executive Order D-39-01     ###

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: House Accepts Commerce Commitee language! ;;;   I just spoke to the House Agriculture Committee Senior Staff who told me that  the House will accept the Commerce Committee language.  The Energy Group has  been very active in support of the Commerce language because it includes both  bilateral and multilateral exemptions for all non-agriculture commodities  (including metals).  This is a siginificant development because the CFTC and  NYMEX have been opposed to the Commerce language especially as it applies to  metals and electronic trading.    The House leadership hopes to have the CEA Reauthorization bill on the floor  later this week or early next under the suspension calendar (which means that  the bill could be voice voted without amendment).  Next to the Senate... where the CFTC and NYMEX will be equally vigilant and  have good relations with Banking Committee Ranking member Harkin.  We plan to  meet with the interested parties sometime this week at which time we hope to  debunk the myth that an unregulated OTC energy market could lead (or has led)  to high oil prices.  More to follow.   Thanks - Chris 
__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Trade Zone changes for Sea Robin ;;;   Chris, Faye has completed moving all of the facilities on your request,  EXCEPT meter 006335 because a deal that is booked on that meter had volumes  with a status other than "expected" which means we have to work on that  behind the scenes.  Below is a list of deals that were impacted by her moving  all of the other meters.  I am bouncing the server and it wil take about 15  minutes to complete.  After that, you will have to get completely out of all  open Sitara applications (including the Launch Pad) and get back in.  Open  the deals listed below and make sure the location field on the deal exchange  says "inconsistent".  You should only be concerned with the exchanges for  6/1/00 and forward.  Click Edit and then go to the location field and click  on the ellipsis.  Click OK when the Facility dialogue box opens and the  correct zone should appear automatically.  Before you tab out of that field,  make sure that the deal volume equals the expected volume.  If the volumes  are not equal, make a note of the expected volumes and how they are broken  out because they will default to the deal volume as soon as you tab out.  If  the volumes are different, update them as necessary and then release the  deal.  Repeat this for all exchanges for 6/1/00 and forward and for all  deals.  The second thing you need to do is identify any swaps that are linked  to the physical forwards.  If none are linked then that's great because you  won't have to worry about that.  If some exist, you will have to update the  swap to reflect the correct zone.  To do this, you need to edit the swap, go  to the field location, remove the current (inconsistent) one and add the  correct zone.  Hopefully this makes sense.  Please call me if you have any  questions.  I will follow up with you on the meter 006335 tomorrow.  Sitara ID 139880 139881 144309 146038  Imelda Frayre x35423

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Mathworks ;;;   Molly,  I met Lou in the building lobby last Wednesday and he suggested that he (or his representatives) join the Mathworks presentation to my group).  It's a good software package for mathematical modeling,  but there is a limit to the number of different installations any group can productively use.  I shall take a look at some new features they offer and decide whether it's worth the effort.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: April through August term sheet update ;;;   Term sheet looks fine. As for gas pricing, it seems we'd be better off just settling per the contract. I'm OK with PG&E Topock, but I'm hopeful that either (i) it will prove to be more valuable (closer to So Cal) in the future, or (ii) we can work with PG&E to deliver it to So Cal somehow.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: PP&E - SOP ;;;   John -  I apologize for the delay, earnings release had us swamped!  After discussing the SOP with our expert partner network in Chicago, they said they believe that this SOP has a 50-60% chance of passing.  Definitely not a slam dunk.  That group gave me some general guidelines that are helpful when responding to the standard setters:  stick to the current literature (other authoritative literature that contradicts/supports your position), cost vs. benefit analysis of implementing the new rules, usefullness of new information required by the new standard to the reader, and try to stick with the facts and try not to be negative (i.e. "we don't like it" type statements).  We are still drafting the official Firm position on the SOP.  However, we generally agree with the concept that accounting for PP&E/Depreciation should be consistent and comparable between companies.  Please note, that I am not trying to persuade you to support the Firm's preliminary views, rather trying to make the letter more effective when AcSEC reads their letter.  My comments are on the draft letter attached, with my suggestions and comments in yellow.  Call me if you have any questions.

He  doesn't care either way, but he suggested you talk to someone at EES - maybe  Jubran Whalan or Neil Bresnan - about what their intent was with the date.  In the meantime, I can change the date to 12/4 if you'd like. What would be  best? E-mail or call and let me know.  Thanks a lot! Kate @ 503-464-7486    Stephanie Piwetz   12/19/2000 08:15 AM

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FW: Revised Lease Model ;;;   Current negotiations with AALLP has provided us " a new look " at the current  lease model.  It has loosened up somewhat to our benefit.  AALLP has agreed  to a "two bucket" approach as indicated on the attached matrix.  Note that we  may operate under this model until the EITF provides definitive guidance  which is expected in December 2001.    We should now focus on the O&M aspect of an existing or development project.    If we pass bucket one as it relates to O&M and offtake limits of 95% or less,  we will not be in a lease and do not proceed to bucket 2.  Bucket two is  essentially where we have been up to now.    In a nutshell, if Enron does not operate, does not have the ability to hire  and fire the operator (must have less than 50% voting on this), does not set  or approve operating policies and procedures and takes 95% or less of the  offtake, we should not be in a lease and we stop there.  If we supply the  fuel and take 95% or less of the offtake and pass O&M criteria, the fuel  supply agreement must have significant LD's.  See specifics for Bucket 1 on  the attached.  NOTE:  Please keep us in the loop on new deals as we roll out this new  model.  We still need to scrub the deals in order to keep AALLP informed.     Please distribute to those I have missed.   R.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Nine Months Later ;;;   NINE MONTHS LATER   Jack decided to go skiing with his buddy, Bob. They  loaded up Jack's mini van and headed north. After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. They pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night.   "I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently "widowed," she explained. "I'm afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house."   "Don't worry," Jack said. "We'll, be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light"   The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.  Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.   About nine months later, Jack got an unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski  weekend.  He dropped in on his friend Bob and asked, "Bob, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski  holiday up  north?"   "Yes, I do.   "Did you happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?"   "Yes," Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out. "I have to  admit that I did."   "And did you happen to use my name instead of telling her your name?"   Bob's face turned red and he said, "Yeah, sorry, buddy.  I'm afraid I did. Why do you ask?"   "She just died and left me everything."   (And you thought the ending would be different, didn't you?)

Thanks, Jeff  ****************************************************************************** **************** Got the California PUC to agree 1) not to place rate-cap related surcharges  on Direct Access customers in SDG&E's service territory, and 2) not to impose  3 cent rate increase on DA customers in PG&E and Edison service territories. Got the PUC to delay votes threatening to suspend, or end, Direct Access in  California. Got Senators Dunn and Burton to agree to postpone vote on Senator Dunn's  report recommending that the full Sentate vote to 1) find Enron in contempt  and 2) impose steep fines pending compliance by Enron. Got the PUC to postpone a vote which would have 1) amended the way California  applies the "PX Credit" and 2) harmed EES' financial position. Provided the California Assembly Speaker with analysis supporting a  core/noncore electricity market structure in California, which the Speaker  then embraced as his own and established a working group in an attempt to  implement the proposal in California. Helped reach an agreement with Edison to delay a PUC proceeding in which the  Administrative Law Judge could have forced Enron to submit commercially  sensitive information. Helped get California policymakers to agree to 1) raise prices in order to  return the IOUs to creditworthiness; 2) establish a "demand buy-down"  proposal; 3) focus on the need to expedite plant siting and construction; and  4) enter into long-term contracts to reduce exposure to price volatility. Worked with PR and Ken Lay to persuade California's business leaders to get  involved in the effort to resolve California's energy crisis.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Hey ;;;   Yeah - I pretty much became part of the furniture yesterday as I recouped  from the brutality of that weekend. I ended up at a random friend's house at  about 4 a.m., then proceeded to down a couple beers and head for bed at about  6:30. I could not believe it when my alarm went off this morning - it's a  cruel, cruel world when you've got a social schedule like ours. But I  definitely had a good time Saturday, despite the fact that I was ditched by  my ride and locked out of my house, which is never fun after a dozen  cocktails. All in all, though, great party.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: A little Ancillary Services Parable ;;;   As I had a little difficulty expressing my concerns today, I thought that I might offer you a little parable.  One day, an enterprising young boy named Bubba decided to start a lemonade stand in front of his house so that he could afford to buy a GI Joe with the kung fu grip.  He set up a table, painted a sign that read "Lemonade 25 cents", and began to squeeze lemons.  Bubba discovered that he could squeeze enough lemons for about 10 glasses of lemonade each hour.  Bubba had a bothersome little five year old brother named Scooter. Although annoying to Bubba, Scooter loved to do whatever Bubba was doing and decided to set up another lemonade stand right next to his brother's stand.  Scooter was not as strong as Bubba and could only squeeze enough lemonade for about 8 glasses each hour.  Scooter also painted a sign that read "Lemonade 25 cents".  Initially, the two boys could sell about 8 glasses of lemonade each hour between the two of them, but as the weather got hotter they attracted more and more thirsty customers.  Eventually, they were selling about 15 glasses of lemonade each hour.*  As it got hotter and baseball season began, the boys grew less interested in their stands and the GI Joe with the kung fu grip was not getting any closer.  Then, Bubba got an idea.  if he raised his price to 30 cents a glass, he would make a lot more money.  The customers at first would buy their lemonade from Scooter but when he ran out they would buy it from Bubba.  This worked great for Bubba but Scooter did not like his brother making more money for the same lemonade. Because he liked to do whatever his brother was doing, and because he also had his mind set on buying a three foot plastic alligator with the remote action chompers and realistic sounds, he too raised his price by 5 cents. Regardless of the new higher price, the customers kept coming.  "Hey, this is great" the two brothers thought to themselves.  But then, the good times came to a halt.  Bubba's mom discovered that he was charging 30 cents for a glass of lemonade and she ordered him to drop his price back to 25 cents (but not before she bored him about how lemonade had only cost a nickel in her day)**.   Interestingly, she must have forgotten to tell Scooter to do the same (Bubba always suspected that she liked Scooter better anyway).  So, Bubba hatched a new plan.  If he could get Scooter to sell his lemonade for him, he could still receive the higher price the customers were paying***.  Thus, Bubba began making lemonade for Scooter's stand.  Bubba kept his stand open but he never had any lemonade to sell.  Soon a long line set up in front of Bubba's stand, all eager to buy out his cheaper lemonade.   But some of the kids became frustrated and angry when Bubba was not selling any lemonade at his mom's ordered price.   Buzzer, the neighborhood snitch, told Bubba's mother what he was doing and she was not pleased.   She told Bubba "young man, I want you to go out there and sell lemonade for 25 cents to whoever asks for it, or else"!  Fearing for his young life, and knowing that he could not possibly squeeze enough lemons to make all 15 glasses, Bubba made Scooter an "offer he could not refuse".  He told Scooter that he was taking the unsold lemonade from Scooter's stand and would pay him only 20 cents****.  Then, Bubba could sell Scooter's lemonade to the thirsty crowd and still meet the demand while staying out of mom's dog house.  Unfortunately, Scooter realized that this was more hassle than he had expected and went inside to play Nintendo leaving Bubba with the angry crowd and not enough lemonade to sell.   *  Bubba has now become a pivotal supplier of lemonade. ** Bubba's mom has just intervened in his market with a price adjustment. *** Bubba moves his supply to the unrestrained market. **** Scooter's lemonade has just been OOMed.   Whenever two markets are perfect substitutes for each other, market forces will bring the prices into equilibrium through the execution of arbitrage opportunities.  Yet, when the price in one of the two markets is artificially managed, this equilibrium cannot exist.  It would be expected that the market that is price managed will attract more buyers but less suppliers.  If suppliers are not forced to participate in the price managed market, then they will shift their supply to the market without price controls and buyers will have to follow.  This would mark the end of the price controlled market leaving only one market remaining.  On the other hand, if the price controlled market also can force suppliers to deliver into its market, then the buyers would not have to follow the supply.  In fact, in this case, more buyers would shift to the price controlled market if it was perceived to deliver lower prices than the free market.  In this case, demand dries up in the free market and suppliers are forced into the price managed market.  Yet, suppliers must be paid for this forced sale and a regulated price is developed to accomplish a fair compensation.  Thus, relieving us all of the complexities of this thing called competition.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Sunday Weather Update 06/03 ;;;   Hi Everyone...  1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).  2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.    3) EarthSat will issue an "official" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the "Sunday Update" link (near the bottom).  Login is "enron", Password is "enron".  Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*      Enjoy the rest of your weekend... Research Weather Team

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: 624,000 more hours of productivity at State ;;;  sure -- bottom line - you need a special security code to get on line from a computer outside the building. Only 1 in 5 of our employees has gotten the device (fob) that allows you to do this access. This effort is making sure they get fobs into the hands of more (or all) employees so folks can work from home thereby increasing productivity substantially since the 4 in 5 essentially do no work from home once they leave the building until they get in again b/c they don't have access to their email. cdm

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep ;;;   Dear Sally,  After the meeting with Rick & Rick, Beth, David and I discussed how best to perform the 4Q 2001 London Doorsteps and have implemented the following:  - Before any doorstep takes place, the doorsteppers must work directly with EAS to determine what has been done in regards to control reviews.  To date, what we have obtained from London are the self assessments prepared by Operations and will receive copies of EAS/AA reports upon their completion (expected end-Nov).    - Each doorstepping team has had a conference call with EAS to ensure the doorstep team fully understands what has been done to date around the trading controls and where possible issues lie. We are using the reports noted above as a background for these discussions.  - The doorstep teams are all planning to use AA/EAS's deal test results (the only exception to this is Essen, where we feel that additional sampling should be done).    - With the exception of metals (recycling & London) & EOTT, RAC will take on a consulting only role.  - As far as the video conference idea was concerned we felt that if the doorstep team was willing to travel that would be the best way to perform the doorstep.  This is because we feel that there is really no substitute for being in the location to hear side comments, feel what morale is like etc.   Lastly, we have talked to EAS about adding some procedures on to the testing AA is performing, however, they feel they can not take on any additional work.  This is primarily because AA got a late start this year and is feeling challenged to complete their work.     Best regards  Shona

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: DPR Signoff ;;;   The Risk Management Policy requires signoff on the DPR by individuals  designated by the COO and CRO of Enron Corp.  Currently, Greg is the sole  authorized signer.  Given that he is moving into cyberspace it has been  proposed that we split the world in half with John L taking the Western  Hemisphere and John S taking the rest of the world.  I am currently drafting  a memo for Jeff and Rick' s signature to that effect,  In the meantime, I  would expect that Greg remain the official signer.  I will forward that draft  memo to you for commentary under separate cover.  Once we have agreed on who  as responsibility for what, we will ask that the Johns reply to an E-mail  request for approval. Eventually, we will create an automatic approval via  the Executive Reports viewer.  Before finalizing process, there are some  issues that ought to be clarified, such as, who will signoff for the Merchant  Portfolios that are not part of either Johns direct responsibility (Southern  Cone, CALME), Broadband, the Capital Portfolio.  For pure process reasons, we  would like to keep the number of signers ot a minimum.  It is difficult  enough to get Greg to sign off in a timely manner, it would be too cumbersome  for Mike Moscoso or Chris Abel to chase down someone from every business unit  every day for approvals.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions or changes to this proposal. Ted x3-3324 ps. Liz, make sure Greg pays attention to this e-mail!

As we agreed, the Bandwidth group either has or will set  up new EBS Contract numbers for each of these agreements, provide the new EBS  Contract number for EOL Reporting, and provide specific notations and  information regarding inactivation of the Global Contracts database records  so that we don't have 2 "master" numbers for any given contract.       I do not have edit access to Bandwidth contract records in Global and it is  my understanding that the Bandwidth group no longer uses Global -- therefore  none of us involved in this process will have appropriate security rights to  inactivate the Global database records.  I will request appropriate security  access to inactivate the records.  Then, when instructed via e-mail from a  member of the Bandwidth team, I will inactivate the Global Contract database  records.  Our agreement is that I will continue to report Bandwidth master contract  information to EOL until Profile Manager is in production -- with the  understanding from EOL that I cannot see the contract data reported for  Bandwidth masters contracts.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Organizational Changes ;;;   In support of Enron,s continuing efforts to increase its return on invested  capital and direct resources towards our highest return businesses, David  Haug, Chairman and CEO of Enron CALME, Jim Hughes, President and COO of Enron  APACHI, Joe Kishkill, Managing Director of Enron South America, and Frank  Stabler, formerly a Managing Director of Enron CALME, will join Mark Metts in  a corporate wide effort, to help monetize some of Enron,s assets.  David will  help transition the CALME business activities into other parts of Enron while  working with Mark on the asset monetization projects.  David will continue as  an Executive Vice President for Enron Corp and a member of Enron,s Executive  Committee.  Cliff Baxter will oversee this effort.  Consistent with these changes, the CALME group will be divided as follows.   Enron Global LNG and Enron,s Caribbean Basin activities will become part of  the new Enron Global Markets (EGM) group headed by Mike McConnell.  Rick  Bergsieker, President/COO of LNG will continue in that role and in his dual  role as President/COO of Enron Middle East, which will also join EGM. Shawn  Cumberland, President and COO of the Caribbean Basin unit and his executive  team will carry out the transition process for the Caribbean business unit's  people and businesses as part of EGM.  Management of its Colombia and  Venezuela businesses will transfer to Enron South America and its LNG-related  activities to EGM as described above.   The EES related initiatives and people will be transferred to those units.   All of the various international businesses will participate as usual in the  upcoming budget process with their new alignment and continue to meet their  plan targets for 3rd and 4th quarters.  Concurrently, we are consolidating our trading and merchant activities in  Japan and Australia into Enron Europe.  Joe Hirl and Paul Quilkey will report  to Enron Europe,s Office of the Chairman.  We congratulate David Haug and Rebecca McDonald for proposing these  realignments, which we agree, will maximize both the financial and  intellectual capital in Enron.  Over the coming weeks, specific assignments  and reporting relationships will be determined and communicated.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Hendricks v. Dynegy ;;;   Today, I worked with Robin Gibbs and Jeff Alexander on an Enron pleading in  the captioned case.  I asked if we had considered asking FERC Staff to file a  "friend of the court" brief detailing how FERC has "occupied the field" of  wholesale rate regulation.  Was this or should this be considered?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: ;;;   Hadn't really thought about that.  In each contract, counterparty reps and  warrants that it physically handles each commodity on which an option is  traded (tracking "trade option" regulatory language), and all r&w's are  deemed repeated each time a new transaction is entered into.    The law requires that on offeror have a "reasonable basis" to believe that  offeree is physically handling, so traders/marketers in the ag area must be  trained to not ignore obvious indications that an ag counterparty is no  longer in the business of physically moving a given ag commodity.  Such  indications should be reported to legal department.  This will be of heightened concern in the ag area.  With other commodities,  if the counterparty doesn't handle, or stops handling the commodity, we can  always argue that we are the "offeree" and we are physically handling.  Until  we are physically handling ag commodities, though, we will always have to  rely on the counterparty being a physical merchant in order to trade options     Robert E.
