__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Company saving idea ;;;   Hi, My name is Kevin Jackson and I had an idea while at the Body shop today.  Would it be possible to propose that Enron operate as a subsidiary of Dynegy, with the option to become an independent company after two years?  Without understanding the details of the merger conversations and options, it is my feeling that this could be beneficial for both companies.  Enron would obtain the cash infusion that it need, maintaining the culture and pulse of what makes us leaders; and Dynegy would retain its stock value and increase its bottom line profitability by having Enron as a substantial asset to its overall business portfolio.  We as employees of Enron are here because we are proud of a culture that sets us apart from any other company in the world.  Regardless of what is going on around us, we can still stand proud of what we have accomplished and the great talent pool we have here.  I know times are tough for you now as it is for us all, but we will survive and I support and trust your vision that made us a great company.  Thanks and I am interested in your feedback.

I am working on our own and helping EPSA with their comments on the Barton language which is, as we know, a retrenchment from current law and FERC's plans on RTOs.  But if Pat Wood likes it and thinks it is "balanced" that undercuts our position.  Since the trade press is not always accurate, I thought I would first check with those of you who were there.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT:  ;;;   Greg,  Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:  Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf  (rentable)  What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?  Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2%  overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.  Why is profit only 4%?   Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.  What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to  boost loan amount but not a real cost?  Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who  receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?  Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?  What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts  NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40%  expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage  would only be 1.16.  Talk to you this afternoon.  Phillip

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales ;;;   Diane MacNeil 1502 Augusta Drive Marietta, GA 30067 dmacneil@computerpsychologist.com  To Mr. Ken Lay,  I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.  Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.  The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.  Sincerely,  Diane MacNeil

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Power Development in California ;;;   Calpine Announces Development of 600-MW Energy Center  Calpine Corporation announced that through a development agreement with Adair  International Oil   and Gas, Inc. it has secured the rights to develop, build, own and operate a  600-MW natural gas-fired   electricity generating facility near the town of Thermal in Riverside County,  CA. The $275 million Teayawa   Energy Center will be located on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla  Indians' land through a long-term   lease agreement between Calpine and the Torres Martinez.   Construction of the project may begin as soon as mid-2001, with commercial  operation slated to begin in   late 2003. The project will interconnect with an existing transmission line  adjacent to the property.   As the power project is located on Native American land, the lead permitting  agency under the National  Environmental Policy Act is the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).  Additionally, BIA approval is necessary   to ensure that the Teayawa Energy Center appropriately meets the cultural,  environmental and economic   considerations of the Torres Martinez.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Greening the Enron Building Mtg ;;;   You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to  discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building,  Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously  and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the  same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA  (Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from  our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium  (details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the  1st Fortune 500 company to "go green" in its headquarters building.  Couple  this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.    We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).  The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for  actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win  proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in  our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals,  and steps for moving forward.     The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or  someone from your group can attend.  Stacey Bolton Environmental Strategies Enron Corp 3-9916

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: ADS Issue:  separation of OOM and OOS ;;;   ADS users:  I have received numerous comments from TSWG regarding concerns about the planned implementation of the same service type for OOS and OOM type dispatches in ADS phase II .   Market Operations' current position is that the Market Participants have all the information they need to decode OOS and OOM, such as what has been bid, what has been dispatched, what proxy bids have been created based on available capacity, etc.  However, we will consider a change to separate the OOS and OOM dispatches.  In order to fully weigh the ramifications of this decision, I want to solicit examples/scenarios where Market Participant systems would not be able to correctly settle against a combined OOS/OOM dispatch through ADS.  If you are interested in this issue, please strengthen your case by sending me an email with comments by 8/16/01.  I would especially like to see comments regarding how must-offer fits in, including issues with proxy bids and whether OOM will apply to must offer units.  Thanks,  Greg Ford California ISO Market Operations (916) 351-2344 gford@caiso.com
__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Rep Agreement ;;;   Sara, in the interest of time this morning, I thought  I would send a quick  e-mail. I have read the appendix to the repo agreement and think it is OK.   No accounting issues, I think they just want to address the substitution  mechanics.  Technically, repo transactions are FAS 125 transactions (sales of  financial assets), so I presume that is why the "FAS 125" is noted at the top  of the page (I don't believe it is necessary - what value does it add?).  I  think the issue is one for Treasury  - are we OK with the counterparties  ability to terminate the contract if we do not agree to the replacement  (substituted) securities? Hope this helps.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: EOL Confirmations ;;;   I did havea brief conversation with Janice about this but don't remember her  conclusions.  For financial transactions we are attaching the GTC's.  That is  the way we handle the regular telephone trading and in an attempt to make the  online trading look as much like telephone trading as possible we continue  the tradition.  If in current liquids trading the terms and conditions are  not sent as part of the confirm (where there is no master in place) I don't  know why we need to attach them for online trading.  If the back office needs  a Word version of the GTC to make their job easier there should be no problem  getting one for them.     Nony Flores 01/05/2000 02:50 PM

Friday, May 4 meeting at 1:30 pm in the CMTA conference room to  discuss Windfall Profits Tax bills   Due to a scheduling conflict, we are changing our Thursday, 2:00 pm meeting  to Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm.   As most of you are aware, CMTA is opposing legislation designed to impose a  Windfall Profits Tax on electricity generator  companies.? The bills are SBX1 1 (Soto) and ABX1 128 (Corbett).? Please note  that the Soto bill pertains to co-generators as  well as entities exclusively in the power business.? That means that many of  you would be directly effected.? The other primary  basis for opposition is that the bills would inhibit electrical supply.?  Please also note that, to the extent that SBX1 1 (Soto) were  operative, it would impose the "windfall cost" on business taxpayers who  would fund the credit given to personal income tax  taxpayers.   You are invited to our lobbying strategy meeting which will be here at CMTA's  offices at 980 9th Street, Suite 2200  on Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm.?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Quick Question RE: COMEX bid/offers for Reuters ;;;   That's probably OK - just a little further into the gray.  The main concern  is that we not be "marketing" the product with reference to the exchange - in  our view using the exchange in the name of the product would be a problem but  references to the exchange may be acceptable in the product description - an  example of what would not work would be describing the product as a "COMEX  lookalike" or something similar.      	Paul Goddard@ENRON 	04/19/2001 09:08 AM 		 		 To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc: Dave Samuels/hou/ect@ECT, Imelda Frayre/LON/ECT@ECT, Justin  Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Greenberg/NA/Enron@ENRON 		 Subject: Re: Quick Question RE: COMEX bid/offers for Reuters  Thanks Mark - my understanding however is that the long description with the  reference to COMEX will be viewable by Reuters users so does this change your  view or would we still be okay, given that the reference to COMEX is quite  benign (i.e. we have similar references in our long descriptions for IPE,  Platts etc.)?
__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Enron MS Walk & Roll - PLEASE READ ;;;   ENRON MS WALK ) RAIN OR SHINE Saturday, April 21 Walk Begins 9:00 am sharp World Trade Center  121 SW Salmon Portland, Oregon   CONGRATULATIONS!  Your commitment to join TEAM ENRON has helped our TEAM be  the LARGEST MS team in the state of Oregon.  This is a great achievement and  one that we can all be proud of.  Your commitment to this Walk and the  pledges you raise will help to find the cause and cure for multiple sclerosis.  At the time of this email notice, approximately 150 TEAM ENRON walkers have  registered.  The following Q&A will provide instructions/directions in order  for us to have a successful Walk this Saturday!  Where is the Enron MS Walk held this year? This year,s Walk begins and ends at 1st & Salmon Street, near the Salmon  Street Springs ) in Waterfront Park.  Registration will be  directly across  the street at Two World Trade Center (middle building of PGE,s offices at 2nd  & Salmon).  What time does the Walk begin and how far is it? The Walk begins at 9:00 am ) rain or shine!  You can elect to walk in the 5K  or 10K ) no decision or commitment needs to be made; just decide the day of  the event.  It is recommended, due to parking constraints, that all Walkers  arrive downtown by 8:00 am, in order to complete required tasks before the  Walk.    Can I bring my dog with me? You sure can!  All TEAM ENRON dogs are welcome to walk with their owners for  this great cause.  All dogs should have leashes.  Just be sure to bring along  your own pooper-scoopers for this purpose.   Where do I meet up with TEAM ENRON? TEAM ENRON walkers will meet around 8:30 am near Salmon Street Springs ) look  for the TEAM ENRON sign.  There will be lots of activity and people in this  area, so plan ahead to meet up with your fellow TEAM ENRON walkers no later  than 8:45 am.    I haven,t received my TEAM ENRON t-shirt ) what do I do? Because of the number of TEAM ENRON registrants and the various locations of  our TEAM walkers, it may not be possible to deliver t-shirts to each walker.   Therefore, if you HAVE NOT received your TEAM ENRON t-shirt by the end of the  work day on Friday, April 20, please plan on picking up your t-shirt between  8:00-8:30 am on Walk Day.  Pick-up location will be at One World Trade Center  on the Bridge Level (at the top of the escalators).  T-shirts will be  distributed at this location from 8:00-8:30 am  ONLY..  Am I suppose to wear my TEAM ENRON t-shirt at the Walk? Yes, yes, yes!  As the title sponsor of this year,s Walk for the state of  Oregon, we want to show off our name and support for this great cause!    What if I have NOT turned in my pledge form to a Team Captain before the Walk? No problem.  We encourage you to turn in your pledges at the MS registration  tables at Two World Trade Center prior to the Walk that morning.  Most of you  have received the yellow notice and white envelope in the mail from the MS  Society.  This envelope is to be used to put your pledge form and collected  dollars/checks in.  If you did NOT receive the yellow notice and white  envelope in the mail from the MS Society, they will provide an envelope for  this purpose at the MS Registration table.   Upon turning in your pledge form at the Registration table, you will receive  an MS walk t-shirt.  (For those that have already turned in their pledges  prior to Saturday, the MS Walk t-shirt will be delivered or sent to you.)  I thought I was pre-registered and the pledges would be picked up prior to  the Walk. Again, because of the various locations for our Walkers, it may not be  possible to pick up all pledges.   If your pledge form is NOT picked up prior  to the end of the work day this Friday, you will need to do the following: 1) Pick up your TEAM ENRON t-shirt (instructions above) 2) Go to MS Registration Table to turn in your pledge form 3) Pick up your MS Walk t-shirt at the same time you turn in your pledge  form. (You will only receive your MS Walk t-shirt once your pledge forms have  been turned in.)  I have a friend that wants to walk but isn,t registered, can they register  the day of event? Absolutely.  Send that friend to the &Walk On,s8 table in the Registration  area.  Be sure to have them sign on as TEAM ENRON walker!  Do I need to bring anything else with me for this Walk? If you plan on carrying anything with you, ie,identification, wallet, MS walk  t-shirt, water, umbrella, camera, munchies, etc., you may want to carry a  backpack.     Does Enron match employee contributions? Enron will match Enron Broadband Services and Enron North America employee  contributions.  If you have not completed a matching form, please contact  your team captain.  These employee contributions are matched 100% and adds up  easily.  Is this tax-deductible and how are receipts given? You bet it is tax-deductible.  If a pledge is $75 or greater, a  tax-deductible receipt will be sent directly from the MS Society.  However,  if the pledge is less than $75 and a receipt is requested, a receipt needs to  be provided by the Walker.  You can pick these receipts up at the MS  Registration Table or contact Judy Timson, 503/886-0501 or email her at  judy_timson@enron.net.  What if I have not collected all my pledges OR have forgotten my pledge form  at home? Not to worry.  You have until May 25 to turn in your pledge forms and dollars  to the MS Society, in order to be eligible for the prizes offered by the  sponsors of this Walk.  If your pledges are turned in after the MS Walk, they  should be sent as follows:     National MS Society    Portland Chapter    1650 NW Naito Parkway    Suite 190    Portland, OR  97209    (Phone 503/223-9511)  How does this work for TEAM ENRON prizes IF my pledge form does not get  turned in the day of the Event? The TEAM ENRON deadline is earlier due to the key prize award of two  round-trip airline tickets on Continental Airlines. In order to be eligible  for this prize, you must have ALL your pledges into the MS Society by April  30th.   How am I eligible for the two round-trip Continental Airline tickets? One of the TEAM ENRON walkers will walk away with this grand prize.  On May  1, the MS Society will confirm with Judy Timson which TEAM ENRON walker  successfully raised the most dollars.  Judy will then contact the grand prize  winner by phone. Notification of the WINNING WALKER will be sent out, via  email, to all registrants that provided an email address.  GOOD LUCK and  continue collecting ) you could be the lucky winner of this wonderful prize!   I thought there were other incentive prizes ) what are they AND how am I  eligible for those? For every TEAM ENRON walker participating in the MS Walk, your name will be  in a drawing to receive one of the following prizes: ? Overnight Hotel Package at The Benson Hotel ? Overnight Hotel Package at The Riverplace Hotel ? Overnight Hotel Package at The Marriott Downtown Hotel ? Overnight Hotel Package at The Marriott Residence Inn This drawing will take place on April 25.  The winners will be contacted by  phone; notification of these WINNING WALKERS will be sent out, via email, to  all registrants that provided an email address.  Are kids allowed to walk and is there a Prize for them? Yes, kids can participate in the Walk.  All kids will be eligible for a $25  gift certificate to Toys-R-Us, with one lucky winner taking home this gift  certificate.  This drawing will take place on April 25.  The winner will be  contacted by phone; notification of this WINNING WALKER will be sent out, via  email, to all registrants that provided an email address.  Are TEAM ENRON walkers to meet after the Walk? No, due to participating in the 5K or 10K and due to people,s own walking  times, it would be difficult to hold a gathering afterwards.  However, we  encourage all TEAM ENRON walkers to enjoy the activities, booths, music,  refreshments, food, etc., that will be provided at the end of the Walk.  What if I have questions? Please feel free to call Judy Timson, 503/886-0501 or email your question:  judy_timson@enron.net.    Walk in good health and have great time!

If you guys are interested in doing this, I think our  next step is to give Citizens a ballpark estimate of what we would charge to  operate their Griffith system.  We can "hedge" our proposal based on the need  to see the installed equipment specs and/or what other equipment might be  necessary to integrate these facilities into our operations.

The company said it is taking this action in light of its   unreimbursed energy costs which are now increasing by more than $300 million   per month, continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the   company, and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Governor Gray   Davis and his representatives are going nowhere.    Neither PG&E Corporation nor any of its other subsidiaries, including its   National Energy Group, have filed for Chapter 11 reorganization or are   affected by the utility's filing.    "We chose to file for Chapter 11 reorganization affirmatively because we   expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a solution, which   thus far the State and the State's regulators have been unable to achieve,"   said Robert D. Glynn, Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. "The   regulatory and political processes have failed us, and now we are turning to   the court."    Glynn added, "Our objective is to move through the Chapter 11 reorganization   process as quickly as possible, without disruption to our operations or   inconvenience to our customers. Throughout this crisis, our 20,000 employees   have been and remain committed to providing safe and reliable service to the   13 million Californians who depend on us to deliver their gas and   electricity."    Pacific Gas and Electric Company decided to file for the protection of   Chapter 11 primarily due to:

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Clarification of "First of the Month" Termination Date ;;;   Unless there have been recent changes of which I am unaware, a "gas day" runs  from 8:00 a.m. on one day until 8:00 a.m. on the next day.  Based on this  premise, I need to get a clarification of what you actually mean when you do  a termination letter stating that a contract will be terminated on the first  of a particular month.  As the systems currently work, if a termination date is entered as the first  of any month, the deal is rolled over in Sitara for the ENTIRE month.  If Sitara was changed to better read the dates from Global Contracts, it  would still roll the deal over & allow gas to flow through the 1st (which  would actually be until 8:00 a.m. on the 2nd).  When you terminate a contract on the first of any month:  Do you mean that gas should only flow through the end of the previous month  (which would end at 8:00 a.m. on the 1st of the next month)?  or  Do you mean that gas should flow through the end of the 1st day of the month  (which would end at 8:00 a.m. on the 2nd of the month)?  or  Can it be either, based on the individual situation?  (If so, please explain.)  Please let me know your views on this issue.  I have requested the IT group  to change all of the "1st of a month" termination dates in Global Contracts  to the last day of the previous month in order to prevent Sitara from  assuming that the deal is good for the entire next month.  But, before they  act on this request, we want to make sure that we are interpreting the  meaning correctly.  Thanks in advance for your help.

Chase has $5 billion invested in 120 different fund families and more than 320 different limited partnerships managed by firms including Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and Hicks Muse Tate & Furst. Chase will sell a portion of its investments in the various funds. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts declined to comment on the development; Bain and Hicks Muse could not be reached for comment. The maneuver is intended to free up capital for future investments in additional LBO funds. The sale of the secondary investments will not affect Chase Capital Partners' direct equity investments. http://www.chasecapital.com/

This is a huge issue in  getting wholesale  electricity markets to work effectively, i.e; to create discernable  consumer  welfare benefits.... and we ( Enron ) need to talk about this this issue and  concern and talk about it frequently and w/ the same passion we talk about  the need for open markets.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast ;;;   Dear Vincent,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   On Friday, we'll bring you the latest from Washington on the final day of the FERC's weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations.  Participants have told our bureau the workshop has been productive and tomorrow we'll find out how the meetings might impact FERC's implementation of RTOs.  Former FERC Commissioner Don Santa will give us his thoughts during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast on where RTOs stand now.   We'll also get more reaction to the nomination of Joe Kelliher to fill the open seat at the FERC.  Gay Friedmann of the INGAA will give us her thoughts on Kelliher's nomination during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.   Finally from Washington on Friday, we'll bring you the latest from Congress on energy legislation.  The anthrax scare has impacted an already crowded Congressional calendar and there's mixed opinion in the Senate on whether lawmakers there will vote on a comprehensive energy bill this year.     ENL's Gale Smith reports, a major energy company is launching a  one-of-a-kind Web site to buy fuel.  The unique idea behind this is that customers helped develop the site.  Motiva Vice President of Commercial Marketing and Distribution Ralph Grimmer talks about the site from the Houston bureau on Friday.   The Houston bureau will also bring us a report on Sakonnet Technology on Friday.  Sakonnet was started by a handful of former employees from JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch and has found success by being able to offer the same level of support as more established investment banks - for less money.  Join us tomorrow from the Houston bureau for all the details on Sakonnet.      From the West Coast bureau, ENL's Kym McNicholas says we'll have word on Friday from Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's press conference and remarks from his keynote address at Hoover Institution's Conference on California's electricity crisis.       California Governor Gray Davis is expected to announce his administration's strategy to attempt renegotiation of the long-term power contracts the state signed between January and September of this year with electricity providers.  Log on for these stories and more from the West Coast bureau.    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Path 15 - FYI ;;;   SAN FRANCISCO - Pacific Gas and Electric Company released the following statement in response to today,s announcement by the Department of Energy, directing the Western Area Power Authority (WAPA) to make upgrades to the congested section of the Path 15 transmission line in Central California:  &As more power plants come on-line in California and the Western states over the next few years, the transmission system needs to be enhanced to move the new power to where it,s needed. The upgrades to be pursued by the Department of Energy will help to eliminate the congestion that currently exists, and provide additional room to move the output from the new power resources that are planned and under construction in the Western United States. &We applaud the DOE,s efforts to expand Path 15 in order to increase the flow of electricity between Northern and Southern California.  The participation of the federal government in this upgrade will be of substantial benefit not only to California, but also to the entire Western grid, particularly in terms of significantly expediting the permitting process, as well as reducing the overall project cost. &Clearly, in addition to California,s retail electricity customers, there are several other groups that stand to benefit from increased Path 15 capacity - primarily municipally owned utilities, as well as federal and state agencies like the California Department of Water Resources and the Western Area Power Authority. Several times over the past decade, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has attempted to work with these groups on ways to fairly share the costs and benefits of any upgrade.  However, in each case, these interests have declined to participate in upgrading Path 15, leaving the cost of making the upgrade to be born only by PG&E,s retail customers. In at least one case, the California Public Utilities Commission determined the effort to upgrade Path 15 was uneconomic. &In the meantime, the utility has made several low cost, high benefit upgrades to Path 15, which have successfully increased its capacity. Furthermore, earlier this year, the utility performed preliminary environmental studies that should help expedite the development of an upgrade of Path 15. &Pacific Gas and Electric Company looks forward to working with the DOE and WAPA to accelerate the development of this needed transmission upgrade.8

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Issues for Mtg with Delainey on 2-28-01 ;;;   It's always darkest before the light (though it may not get light in our  lifetimes).  Looks great.  Couple of points:  1) Despite promises to the contrary--common theme in this exercise--Burton  (as I understand) did not remove the condemnation (expropriation?) language  from ABx6, i.e., the state can just take your power plant (or anything else,  it seems), if it has the inkling.  That's an egregious provision in ABx6.  2) I don't recall trying to amend ABx18 to say, "pay them their PX credits."   I understood the tactic to be--get a prospective, date certain end to the  freeze in the bill, which then gives us very firm legal ground on which to  seek and get the money owed to us.  We could seek the additional language,  but if putting date certain does the same thing without attracting a lot of  attention, may be a preferable path.  3) Forgive me if I've just overlooked it, but I got wind of a bill by Ms  Migden (ABx8?)  that gives one whole heckuvalot of new power--power usually  left to FERC--to the CA Electricity Oversight Board.  Anyone know about it?   We may want to get details for inclusion in the discussion with Delainey.    Best, Jeff

This  notice is revised to include the Ex- Atlanta Southern Group ATLANTA, EX-ATLANTA SNG,  MACON, AUGUSTA , and ROME Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system  cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of  the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your  interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your  interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order. Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their  interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order.  Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer  contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC  internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for  curtailments.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: PACIFIC VIRGO ;;;   Matt,   Good report.  I am concerned about this expert's conclusions, the most  troubling of which is that our putting the ship on notice of the end use of  the cargo would have been of so little importance.  That is probably our  strongest point.  I also share your concern about his lack of experience as a  witness in an arbitration.  We need an expert who is well respected by U.K.  arbitrators and their tribunals.  I will likewise try to get other names.   Meanwhile, I question whether we should ask Capt Sawant to put anything in  writing concerning how to beef up his second report until we talk further.  I  am concerned that anything he puts in writing may be discoverable in a U.K.  arbitration proceeding if we use him as an expert and/or if he has any  otherwise discoverable factual information.  Would you mind passing this  concern by WFW for its comment?  I am assuming that the WFW counsel with whom  you are speaking are experienced maritime arbitration counsel.   Thank you for keeping us advised.  Deborah, please print this out (including  the attachment) for the file.

Although Capt Sawant is  very knowledgeable, he has never been an expert witness in an Arbitration. I  will be discussing with WFW about alternative experts.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Larry's on the Loose!!! ;;;   Panic-Hit City Hunts 'Ape-Like' Attacker    NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Fear gripped some suburbs of the Indian capital on Tuesday after dozens of residents reported attacks by an ape-like creature able to leap from roof to roof.  Police had received about 65 reports of a mysterious attacker with a monkey's face and human body scratching and biting victims in and around Delhi since Saturday, a senior police official told Reuters on Tuesday.  Police said they had no clues about the identity of the alleged attacker.  "Last night (Monday) alone we received 24 calls reporting such attacks," Manoj Lal, Deputy Commissioner of Police of Delhi's eastern district, told Reuters. "Of these, 19 were found to have no basis. The five others had some wounds and we are trying to confirm with doctors how they may have been caused," he said.  Television network Star News said people in neighboring Ghaziabad town -- which reported the first attack two weeks ago -- spent the night on the streets armed with sticks waiting for the attacker.  Lal said the entire eastern district police force of about 3,000 personnel had been on patrol since Monday to hunt down the creature.  The Times of India said an industrial worker died on Sunday night in nearby Noida town when he jumped off a first-floor building after being awoken by cries the "monkey man" was attacking.  There are a number of monkeys running wild in New Delhi and on the outskirts of the city which sometimes pounce on unsuspecting pedestrians or enter houses.  Copyright 2001 Reuters News Service.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Computer Based Communications Training Initiative - Response Reminder for Feedback ;;;   In my interview I stressed that a big part of the communication problem is  the narrow and impermanent nature of the information about what's going on at  Enron.  Narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few  who are in the loop and "impermanent" because very little information is  committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone).   This is, I believe, what lies at the heart of complaints about  cross-department communication.  We now have some solutions emerging --  software that enables more people to record and post information in HTML  format on company intranet sites.  I suspect that using such tools will face  two obstacles: learning how to use them (ie there's a huge need for training)  and making it part of our culture as a knowledge/learning organization     Richard Amabile 08/18/2000 05:20 PM

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Sunday 12/18/01 WX 4KZ ;;;   Good Morning!  Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month.  For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week. Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation. 6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected. Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East. 11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow.  So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today: Sun 	11/18 	47 Bcfd  Mon 	11/19 	54 Bcfd  Tue 	11/20 	67 Bcfd  Wed 	11/21 	69 Bcfd  Thu 	11/22 	65 Bcfd  Fri 	11/23 	62 Bcfd  Sat 	11/24 	61 Bcfd  Sun 	11/25 	62 Bcfd  Mon 	11/26 	64 Bcfd  Tue 	11/27 	63 Bcfd  Till tomorrow,  The Weather Team

Credit matrix and 2. Threshold   amount     Dear John,    Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to   the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly   their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in   place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They   acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards   CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did   say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do   so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are   set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask   them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.    We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you   are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess   this means US$15 million credit limit.      On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract   without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be   able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the   drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?         Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the   "Threshold Amount" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on   this?    Thanks.

We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and   they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC)   clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot   automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We   are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates,   the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to   IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is   it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without   using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a   CSA).    Rating (S&P)     Credit Line  AA or above    $20MM  BBB+ to AA-    $15MM  BBB     $10MM  BBB-     $7MM  BB- to BB+    $5MM  Below BB-    $1MM    These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC   clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively   reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with   diminishing credit quality.    What do you all think?    John          Jonathan Whitehead @ ENRON   09/25/2000 08:18 PM

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Lay's Comments to FERC on Power Market ;;;   Note:  The FERC meeting is today.  See the link below that can be checked for  updates.  Enron's Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes  As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning  with the federal government's answer to California's be-deviled power market,  free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price  cap route espoused by the Cal-ISO. FERC's meeting is scheduled to start at 9  AM EST. (Check http://intelligencepress.com this morning for updates)   In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker yesterday, Enron CEO  Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural  problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers  who have placed "price cap 'band aids' over hemorrhaging wounds."   Lay told Hoecker the power market is "halfway across a busy street in its  transition from monopoly to competition. It can't stand where it is." He said  FERC has to make a choice between falling into the "same trap of political  expediency as California's ISO, leaving the nation's electric system in the  lurch from one crisis to the next, [o]r it can take a big step toward  fundamental structural reform."   At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) called on FERC  to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the Cal-ISO from  "unilaterally implementing" any changes to its current $250/MWh price cap for  wholesale electricity purchases. In a motion filed Monday, the marketer group  specifically asked the Commission to bar the Cal-ISO board of directors from  putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex  load-differentiated price cap of $100 or less during the off-peak season  effective Nov. 3. The plan was designed by the state's main utility consumer  group (see Daily GPI, Oct. 30). In addition, the EPSA urged FERC to "state  explicitly" that the Cal-ISO does not have the authority to impose or extend  price or bid caps, unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission.  The Cal-ISO's current authority to set price caps expires on Nov. 15.   Lay said the Cal-ISO's complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of  gas-fired generation, "making obvious errors such as failing to take into  account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in  California; in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to  sell their gas supply, rather than use it to make electricity in California."  The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc  basis "to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract  sufficient supplies (which it inevitably will do)," Lay said. In addition,  the capped formula "invites generators to shut in production, export power  out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries."   He noted that the ISO's Chairman voted against the measure while all of the  state's utilities voted for it "presumably knowing full well that it simply  will not work."   California is "just the latest failure of partial or compromised open  access," said Lay. "It's time for the Commission to reject this approach.   "The power industry --- the nation's most essential industry --- is mired in  the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice.  Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one  vested interest or another. As a result, utilities are free to slow the  interconnection of new generation, withhold equal access to the transmission  system, favor their own sales over those of competitors, miscalculated  available transmission capacity, and exercise control over supposedly  'independent' system operators and reliability organizations.   Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would  "plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and  conservation methods..."   FERC has to complete the work that it started, said Lay. It has to ensure  that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by "ending the  special priority for utility uses of the system. Second, FERC must require  transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets  from their other businesses. Third, FERC must take politics out of  transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure  independence. Finally, FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps  by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate  efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies."   EPSA said the Cal-ISO board "acted in obvious disregard for the Commission's  orderly processes." It "cannot be permitted to make the Commission's  decisions for it, or to alter so radically market rules, thereby injecting  more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for  fashioning fair, effective and comprehensive remedies" for California's  "flawed" electric markets, the group noted.   The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the  California markets will be "severely compromised" if the Cal-ISO board's  imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Origination opportunity with Cheyenne ;;;   PacifiCorp terminated its service to Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power effective  2/ 24.  Below is a summary of the  dispute between PacifiCorp and Cheyenne and FERC resolution.  Here's your  chance to be a hero.    On December 20, Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Co. filed a complaint against  PacifiCorp requesting  the FERC to order PacifiCorp to continue service to Cheyenne under the rates,  terms and conditions of the  Power Sales Agreement (PSA) following December 31, 2000, until at least such  time as PacifiCorp has provided  notice of termination a minimum of 60 days in advance of the proposed  termination date. Cheyenne is a full  requirements customer of PacifiCorp under a power sales agreement executed  and filed with FERC in 1995  with a term that expires on December 31, 2000. Cheyenne has attempted to  agree to terms with PacifiCorp for  a replacement power sales agreement, but PacifiCorp has demanded prices many  times higher than current  prices under the PSA and substantially higher than the $74 per MWh benchmark  price FERC recently established  as a presumptively prudent long-term price for sales in the California  markets.  PacifiCorp will terminate service  under the PSA upon its expiration on December 31, 2000, but PacifiCorp has  not filed with FERC a notice of  termination of the PSA. Cheyenne stated that termination of service could  impair Cheyenne's ability to serve its retail customers, thereby harming both Cheyenne and its customers. On  December 26, PacifiCorp filed a notice  of termination for the PSA with Cheyenne. On December 27, PacifiCorp filed an  unexecuted letter agreement with  Cheyenne under its market-based tariff for power sales as a replacement for  the Existing Agreement. Order issued  February 7 (1) dismissing Cheyenne,s complaint; (2) accepting PacifiCorp,s  notice of termination and denying its  request for waiver of our notice requirement, to allow the PSA to terminate  at the end of the day on February 24, 2001;  and (3) rejecting PacifiCorp,s unexecuted letter agreement. Since the Order  is denying PacifiCorp,s request for  waiver of notice and accepting the notice of termination and Cheyenne opposed  the rates under this letter agreement  in any event, Order found no need to accept the alternative interim agreement  offered by PacifiCorp. Requests for  Rehearing due March 9.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Rice University ;;;   Steve,  I was informed that Malcom Gillis called you last Friday with some concerns  about EBS' performance.    I put calls into the Director of Networks (Ferrell  Gerbode) and his boss (Chuck Henry) on Friday to discuss this.   Ferrell  apologized and indicated that Gillis didn't understand the whole picture and  he pushed the panic button without talking to them.  I have not received a  call back from Chuck Henry and understand that he is travelling.    The primary bandwidth deal that we did with Rice was re-structured and  delayed until Feb '02 at Rice's request (back in October last year).   They  have now requested a small quantity of interim bandwidth to do some testing  between now and Feb '02.   EBS was slow to respond to this request (change of  account manager and not understanding their sense of urgency) and I believe  this is the source of the call.   We had addressed the problem by meeting  with them the week before, proposing an innovative solution and making a  proposal on Thursday last week.  Gillis wasn't aware that we had responded.    We are now waiting for their response.    Let me know if you would like  further information or if we owe a response to Gillis.  Thanks,  Brad

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: California Energy Crisis ;;;   California,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several  months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We  want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.   Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation  and our position on California energy issues.  What happened in California  The source of California,s current problem is as straightforward as supply  and demand.  California,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This increased  the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory  restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So  demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The result,  predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10  percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.  In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related  factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state,s regulations  forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for  power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market  when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long  term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  In  California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the  equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the  most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine  while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawatt  was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.  Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remained  in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep  competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale  prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the  regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.  In short, California,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulation.   Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new  generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile  spot prices.  At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned  the state,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, which,  if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.  Enron,s Role  Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix  the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the  politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:  ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the  state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the  same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a  market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We are  interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products  for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from  the problems the states, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We  protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.  You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply  power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on  the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a &turnback8 of our  customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:  ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California  market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers directly  from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES,s market price risk by  allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue to  receive the financial benefits of their contract prices. ? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them  with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in  reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.  Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its  crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron  continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western  power markets.  Enron,s primary business is managing risk for our customers  with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more  demand for our products and services.  The Solution  The solution to California,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary, the  state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot market  and shore up the financial stability of the state,s utilities.  Increasing Supply  California,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing  short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less  than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simply  must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations  generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the  regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and  displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can  have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new  facilities.  Reducing Demand  Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand.   They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail  market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and demand  at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market.  Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market  In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from  volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer  term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the hands  of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market.   Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their  price risk.  Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State,s Institutions  The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to  greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to  arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recover  their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and  distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is  needed.  Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that,  while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters  worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don,t work; have never worked;  and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages,  which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how  ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether it  is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Valley  or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current  shortage worse.  The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in  California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that  the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,  constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in  California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power  generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, roads  and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.  As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the  crisis from the media, it,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron will  continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real  solutions to the state.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: DLC and NDN Meetings ;;;   NDN  Senator Bingaman (D-NM) chaired the New Democratic Network (NDN) energy  breakfast this morning. He told me he was looking forward to meet with Ken  later in the day.   He talked about how his Committee plans to proceed,  beginning with the release today to Senators of a document that identifies  issues that were included in both the Murkowski and Bingaman drafts of energy  legislation.  He hopes to make this the starting point for bipartisan  comprehensive legislation. Bob Simon, Committee Staff Director, told me he was interested in working  with Enron.  After Sen. Bingaman departed, Reps. Cal Dooley (D-CA), Ron Kind (D-WI), Adam  Smith (D-WA), and Rick Larsen (D-WA) talked about the New Dems energy plan.   They restated their intent to focus on policy and not the rhetoric being  spread by the Democratic Leadership.  They also say they want a "goal" to  reach, for instance, energy independence by 2020.    I mentioned open access  on the electricity grid as a mid-term energy policy goal.  Follow up:  I spoke to Rep. John Larson's staff about our investment in  fuel  cell technology in Connecticut.  They called and want to meet with us next  Wednesday.  DLC   The DLC is currently considering energy policy and Peter Fox Penner is  leading the drafting.  They hope to have the plan developed and released in  the next month or so. Their proposal will focus on the following issues:   The pre-California regulatory environment clearly did not work as it should.   How can we improve FERC, state and local regulatory regimes to avoid another  California.  Mandate a "Clean Quarter":  Ensure that at least a quarter of all new energy  production come from "clean" energy  sources defined by low emissions  output.  The goal is to increase renewable energy, but it is unrealistic to  deny the need for fossil fuels.  So the DLC would look to mandate renewables  and cleaner burning fossil fuels.  Encourage deregulation and competition,  through support and transition  funds.  The goals is to ease the transition into deregulate markets and the  volatility that often accompany such a transition.  Create investment funds  (like a Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) to make a move to competitive markets  easier and less threatening.  Create a market to tradeable Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard  units.   On transmission, the DLC would expand transmission by creating binding  Regional Electricity Siting Compacts that would ease eminent domain issues.  4P and 3P trading programs.  The DLC would support efforts  to expand  emissions trading beyond S02, to NO2 and Mercury (and possibly CO2).  I spoke  to Pat Shortridge and Lisa Jacobsen and will offer them up to the DLC as  experts on these programs.  Full-scale reexamination of Nuclear as a viable energy source.  Encourage real-time pricing to avoid reliance on spot markets.  Mandate new buildings be constructed "smart" and provide incentives to  encourages large industrials and buildings to outsource their energy needs.     Follow up:  The DLC is going to look to Enron for ideas on how to structure  these proposals over the coming weeks.  Perhaps Rick Shapiro could spend some  time with Peter Fox Penner and Will Marshall when he is in town next week.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: NATO ;;;  I'm heading back from meetings on women, peace and security at NATO. The chief implementer of WPS at DOD also traveled with me. It was extremely productive. SG Rasmussen chaired a meeting on 1325 today of all the NATO member and partner ambassadors incl DaIcier. The new NATO special rep for 1325 -- the position sponsored by Norway and approved at the Chicago summit — gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US efforts both generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom touched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many mentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national action plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement them. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional conflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wanted me to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere! I'm confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own people both at NATO and DOD. I was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on getting the engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts. I also met with Vivian Redding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boards of directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership. In addition to everything that's been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women in Libya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went out of their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him. Such an awful loss. You've been magnificent throughout all this, despite how wrenching it's been.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Enron Updates ;;;   Here is an update of some recent Enron developments.  Enron Europe Closes Certain Operations  Following Enron's credit rating downgrade yesterday and the impact that had on Enron Europe's ability to trade, Enron Europe has asked a court to appoint an Administrator.  What this means is that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed the Administrator to handle the liquidation of the company's major physical assets and trading positions.  This action does not include Enron Credit, Enron Direct, Enron Metals, Teesside Power Station or the utilities and service businesses at the Wilton chemical complex.  It also does not include Wessex Water or power plants in Turkey, Italy and Poland.  Efforts are being made to preserve as much of the business as possible.  There is already interest by outside parties to buy Enron Europe's metals business, and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal in the near term.  This action will impact a significant number of Enron Europe's employees.  Every effort is being made to retain as many employees as possible who are part of businesses that may be preserved.  Enron Appoints New Board Member  Yesterday, Enron announced the election of Raymond S. Troubh to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Troubh will chair a newly-formed Special Litigation Committee of the Board to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits.  He will also serve on the Special Committee set up to investigate all of the SEC-related matters.  Mr. Troubh is a financial consultant in New York City and has been a non-executive director of more than 25 public companies.  Board member William C. Powers, Jr. will also serve on the Special Litigation Committee.  Enron Evaluates Dividends  Today Enron announced that it is evaluating whether previously declared dividends will be paid on Enron common stock and other Enron equities.  New Enron Employee Q&A  A new Q&A has been posted to <http://home.enron.com/updates/> based on recent developments and employee concerns.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: options exercised ;;;   I exercised my options today...for various reasons.  First: stock moved around 1.3 yesterday and was up as high as 1.5 today...now on its way back down.  I exercised when it was 1.0 up....i really felt that this was more a peak for now than a trend up.  Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were selling our India power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (Enron Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably going to move back down.  Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee "consumer" confidence is not good.  Not to mention the fact that I see many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly dissapating.  Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy money....I can always take the money market and get back in enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.  OH...lastly..I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w/ ENE if that market continues to trend up.  So there you go....the most detailed trade report i think i've ever written. Talk to you later hun L-me

Ratings and Cluster Descriptors: Agrees in principal with our suggestion to  use different scales for the 360 rating and the meeting ratings.  He'd like  the meeting rating scale to be numbers vs. adjective descriptors and would  like to use a 1- 5 cluster scale vs. the present 6 clusters.  Item for agenda  for Committee. ? Preferred distribution:  PD should be set by the policy committee.  Item  for agenda for committee. ? Eligibility for PRC- new hires with less than 6 months tenure will not be  on the slate for discussion at PRC meetings.  They will, however, get  feedback via the PEP system.  Bonuses for new hires less than 6 mos. will be  at the discretion of the BU.  Item for agenda for committee. ? Full disclosure of rating results - Delainey wants to discuss this with the  Committee for feedback. ? PRC Coverage:  Non-exempt employees to be reviewed in meeting on a 1-3  scale with no preferred distro applied. ? Employee self eval:  Form to be revised and to include employee  accomplishments.  We'll provide a link in the emp. self eval  form to permit  the emp. the option to provide feedback on supervisor. ? Ensure diverse PRC committee representation:   Lists of proposed PRC  committee members to be sent to Michelle Cash's office for review.  Item for  Committee agenda. ? Rostering:   Delainey wants to discuss  numerical ranking of employees with  the Committee.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: WPTF Friday What is Electricity Burrito ;;;   THE FRIDAY BURRITO   How many of you believe in telekinesis? Raise my hand...   Last week I was in a rare mood.? Before I wrote last week's Burrito, I spent  the better part of Thursday afternoon with my wife sipping wine in Napa  Valley.? Considering the volume of e-mail in response to last week's edition,  I should do more drinking, and less worrying.? But I do worry.? For example,  my wife wants to buy a new car, and this makes me think about one of my  favorite lines, "Get a new car for your spouse - it'll be a great trade!"?  But I haven't told her that because she has a fairly decent left jab;  typically to my head. I drive a 1993 Ford Taurus that has 50k miles.? It  looks like hell, and gets me to where I want to go.? My wife wants a new  Jaguar, top of the line, faster than a bullet.? I was telling this story to  our WPTF counsel, Dan Douglass, who asked, "I don't get it.? You are driving  a beat up old Ford, and your wife is getting a new Jaguar?? How does that  work?"? It's not too hard to explain.? You see, my wife works in Palo Alto,  about 5 miles from our house, whereas I operate the world headquarters of  this pirate trade association from my "home" office.? Each work morning, we  like to arrive at our respective offices at the same time ( in about 3.5  seconds.? Now if that makes sense to you, then maybe you can explain how and  why the State of California thinks it can grow 1000 MWs of peaker generation  from seed to flower in five months.   None of the above has much to do with the electricity crisis, but it is a far  more enjoyable conversation.? In fact, this week needs a good slug of humor.  Therefore, I have expanded the Odds & Ends (_!_) section to include more  stories and jokes.? We deserve it.   I get about six calls a day from newspaper reporters, and they always ask me  at the outset a tough question, "How are you?"? I'm never sure.? All the  other questions are easy, but the How-Are-You question usually trips me up.  One of our members called me and asked if I had heard about Steve Peace's  quote placing the Texas State Flag on top of the California State Capital?? I  had, but I discouraged the caller from sending Peace a Texas Flag as a  prank.? I suggested, instead, sending the Senator a pair of boxer briefs with  the emblem of Texas as the pattern.? We could put a note in the box, "Don't  put your ass in Texas."? Does anyone have a connection on where we can get  the goods?   Our Governor and his staff are actively negotiating the purchase of the  transmission systems from the state's three utilities.? Today the LA Times  reported that PG&E is being obdurate, whereas SCE and SDG&E are being helpful  in the negotiations.? Why does this sound familiar to me?? Most people say  the negotiations are stalled.? The Governor says he will announce a deal  today, this Friday.? The Governor and the rest of the world never seem to be  on the same page.   In the meantime, I am learning all about pre-petition credit committees, and  how they operate.? My hopes are modest for a clean solution to the financial  woes of the California market.? On the other hand, consider all the new  things I am learning.? For example, the difference between a secured and  unsecured creditor has become quite clear.? If you hold a mortgage bond, then  you are a secured creditor.? If you are an electric generator or marketer who  sold to the ISO or to the PX, then you are unsecured.? If you have a picture  of a utility executive (think male) coming out of a motel room with women  other than his spouse, then you are a secured creditor.? If you are a  consumer, taxpayer, and a voter, then you are screwed. As one financial  advisor told me, there are only two sources of revenue to make up the  shortage of money: rate increases and the sale of assets.? Then the advisor  said, think of the money from those funding sources like water at the top of  Yosemite Falls.? As the money cascades down like falling water, secured  creditors are near the top and get very wet.? Unsecured creditors are near  the bottom, and might only get some mist in their face. It all depends how  much water is running over the precipice.   If the state doesn't offer "enough" money for the assets, then I expect the  unsecured creditors will be like Yosemite tourists at the bottom of the Falls  after a dry summer.? The mist spray will be a figment of one's imagination.?  If the state condemns the transmission assets, then there will be a long and  protracted court settlement regarding the fair market value of the assets.?  Not a good outcome if you were expecting to get paid soon. Alternatively, if  the state said to all the generators, "How about 50? on the dollar for each  dollar we owe you?", I doubt there would be many takers.   The secured creditors, by the way, are going to be patient, so it seems.? The  bond underwriters place billions of dollars of bond issues, and they are not  too excited about upsetting the State of California.? Could get in the way of  future business because the state does issue quite a lot of bonds, and the  underwriting fees are good.? So, I don't expect the bond-holders to pull the  trigger anytime soon.   If you thought I was drawing a conclusion based on the discussion above, then  think again. A conclusion is the place where you rest because you got tired  of thinking.   Here is this week's menu.   Things in the People's Republic of California  ?@@@ LA Times Poll Shows We Have Met the Enemy, and It Is Us  ?@@@ APX Opens Discussions on a New Transmission Market  ?@@@ Some Nasty Legislation   Responses to Last Week's Burrito   Jobs and People   Odds & Ends (_!_)  ===================   Things in the People's Republic of California  ?@@@ LA Times Poll Shows We Have Met the Enemy, and It Is Us   Last Sunday, the LA Times published the results of a poll they conducted on  579 Californians, all over the state.? I encourage you to read the survey.?  It's available at http://www.latimes.com/news/state/20010218/t000014901.html  .? The bottom line is that Californians are mixed up about the electricity  crisis in ways that I could have not predicted.   For example, the Governor gets the highest marks relative to all other  players.? His approval rating has gone up from January (29% approval rating)  to 49% in February!? However, the 16% approval rating of the PUC is the  lowest among the Gov., the legislature, the utilities, and even President  Bush. The PUC is a tool of the Governor, but apparently that is a secret only  known to the several thousands of us in the regulated power business (There,  there Ms. Lynch.? They really love you, but they just don't understand you.).  No telling where merchant generators and power marketers might have placed  had our names been on the list, although I am sure it would be at the low end  of the curve.   More than half of those surveyed do not believe there is an actual shortage  of electricity in California!!!!? The response to that issue was the same  last month, and has changed very little.? Can someone explain this attitude  to me?? I don't get it.? What do you have to do to convince Californians that  we are short on capacity? Thirty days in a row of Stage 3 alerts doesn't do  it.? I do not believe that anyone reading the LA Times, say, on a regular  basis for the last month would conclude that there is no electricity  shortage.? That means few people are reading newspapers for their  information.? The rest of the folks get their information from TV, word of  mouth, comic books or (.? Stunning result.   Oddly enough, the public doesn't think too highly of long-term power  contracts, very little about nuclear power, but they do favor, by a margin of  three out of four, more thermal power plants. They would be willing to see  such facilities built and operating in their own communities.   In summary, the Gov. is up, the Legislature down, the shortage is  non-existent, we need more power plants, there is a bailout of the utilities  but that is okay, and people are conserving more than ever.? Is it any  wonder, then, that the legislation we see emanating from the State Capital is  so mixed up.? We are mixed up. What are you going to do about us?   Things in the People's Republic of California  ?@@@ APX Opens Discussions on a New Transmission Market   Automated Power Exchange (APX), now under the helm of new CEO John Yurkanin  held a one-day seminar on the development of a new market to replace the now  defunct PX adjustment bid market.? Adjustment bids, for those of you that do  not trade or schedule in California, are economic signals to the ISO about  one's willingness to adjust your schedule to satisfy transmission constraints  at various transmission bottlenecks on the ISO's grid. APX has provided us  with a thoughtful instrument for managing transmission congestion.? I  attended the meeting, and my take away was that APX is proposing an energy  market that allows different parties to be matched for the purpose of  adjusting energy deliveries on either side of a transmission constraint.? It  looks very much like the InterSC Adjustment Bid market that market  participants so desperately wanted but never received from the ISO.? The  beauty, here, however, is that all the InterSC adjustment bids fall under one  portfolio, APX's, that allows the ISO to maintain the market separation  constraint.   Another benefit provided by APX's new market is the scheduling of RMR units.?  John Stremel of APX told us that the CAISO can contribute to the APX market  if there is a feature to instruct the RMR units.? The ISO could place their  orders through the APX market if the RMR units are willing to submit  adjustment bids in the same.? So doing would give much needed, and now lost  price transparency.   Nothing is free, except grief and heartache, and we all have enough of that.?  APX needs funders to get their market off the ground.? I have heard several  people grumble about the sales pitch, but let's face it.? We have been  complaining for years that the PX was forced on us, the ISO's CONG model was  forced on us, and the RMR dispatch was forced on us.? Now that for the first  time we have an opportunity to exercise choice, I find it ironic that people  are fumbling over the dollars.? The way the ISO is currently handling  congestion management, with no or few adjustment bids, wreaks havoc on the  energy markets.? APX is at least giving us a chance to fix that, and do more.  ?   If you support the APX market in concept, then call John Stremel and tell him  408.517.2120, <jstremel@apx.com>.? If money is a problem, then call him and  tell him that too.? Let's get creative and demonstrate to those who doubt our  ability to pull ourselves up by the bootstrap that we are able and willing to  do so.  ?   Things in the People's Republic of California  ?@@@ Some Nasty Legislation   On the heels of the major pieces of legislation enacted in the last few weeks, we have the "me too" bills that are absolutely nauseating. Here are short summaries of two legislative turds that simply demonstrate what can occur when you have too many law makers taking on too few crises. SB 39x (Speier - D) - This bill would make facilities that have been deemed exempt wholesale generators by FERC become public utilities subject to CPUC jurisdiction. It would authorize the CPUC to ensure that generators located in California are operated in a manner that assures their availability to maintain reliability.? It would allow the CPUC to issue orders and directives as it deems necessary to accomplish this.? It would authorize the CPUC to prevent the exercise of market power by prohibiting economic or physical withholding.? The bill would also authorize the CPUC to prescribe inspection, maintenance, and operating practices and procedures for any generator to ensure the public health and safety , reliability and adequacy of the system. AB 60x - Herztberg - D) - This bill would require as a condition of receiving a CEC certification (for new or re-power) the applicant to offer to sell to California IOU's, Municipal utilities, or DWR, at just and reasonable cost based price, electrical power generated from the facility.? It would also prohibit the operation of the facility until a maintenance and outage schedule has been approved by the CEC.? A violation of this would be a criminal act. Responses to Last Week's Burrito Always helpful and friendly, Ms. Sheryl Lambertson from PPL Montana (Butte) wrote to me about my idea to send California's teen population to Montana.? She said, "I personally invite your son to spend the summer with me.? However, 6 million teenagers in a state with a population of less than a million!!!!!? I think we could potentially have power shortages though I'm sure Montana would do a great job of managing them.? I think we can take one more teenager but we'll leave it at that." Phil Muller of SCD Solutions offered the following in response to Dr. Davis' Cure for What Ails Us, "Now that our distinguished governor has finally announced his plan to save the utilities by taking over their transmission systems in exchange for paying some of their operating expenses, I can see the long term plan.? First, continue to stall resolution of the credit situation while generators continue to sell to the ISO with no immediate prospect of getting paid.? Second, cap QF payments at the "just and reasonable" price of $67/MWh.? Third, offer to "bail out" all the generators by having the state pay a portion of what they're owed in exchange for turning their power plants over to the state.? It looks like Gray learned business from John D Rockefeller.? Force your competitors' prices below cost until they're forced to sell out to you.? Once you own everything you can set your own just and reasonable prices depending on whether you're running for election or not.? This shouldn't be a problem since the state is not subject to anti-trust laws." Long-time friend Bill Metcalfe in Salt Lake City offered the following response to the WPTF seven-point solution.? He wrote, "Price is always a factor for the individual consumer and some commercial establishments who can exercise discretionary conservation but may only discourage/encourage industrial expansion.? Price must reflect the pure mechanics of supply and demand.? Therefore, the health of the California economy is closely linked to the ability to build capacity that will yield a price reflective of our desires for industrial competitiveness and growth. "The more we move to State control and the Governor's plan, the more difficult this all becomes and the costs - well.... "The Dedicated Rate Component (DRC) should provide the necessary incentive for consumer conservation.? Industry may just close up shop when seeing this and considering the future. "As you said, "(this) is like a hungry monster that chews up politicians and spits them out after sucking the political marrow from their bones."? Watch out for quick and seemingly painless fixes - the damage of the past ills does cost."Finally, I received a very thoughtful note from Nancy Day, my personal advisor (although she doesn't know that, but I listen very closely to everything she tells me).? You should, too.? Here is what she wrote:   "I want to offer my thoughts on the Governor's plan and make a few  suggestions.? When Mike Peevey [Note: Peevey was Nancy's former business  partner in the firm New Energy Ventures] was named 'advisor', I sent him the  following words of encouragement:? 'do no harm.'? Now I ask you, will the  Governor's plan 'do no harm?'? If the answer is yes, work with your members  and the utilities to fix the gigantic holes in the cost recovery portion of  the plan.? Although I agree with you that the simplest way to fix what ails  us is to allow the utilities to recover their electricity purchase costs --  evidently that approach carries with it too much political baggage.? So, how  can we make the Governor's plan work?? Be prepared with talking points that  all of your members can use in their discussions with the press, with other  'lobbyists' and with the leadership in the legislature (Burton, Hertzberg, et  al.).   "Here are my suggestions on points you may want to cover:   1) How much does the State really believe the utilities are owed for past  electricity purchases -- is the number $12 billion?? If so, what amortization  period is being assumed in the calculation of the rate increase?? How much of  a rate increase will be required just to cover that past debt?? Is there  enough "headroom" in the utilities' rates to cover the ongoing cost of  electricity (both the utilities own generation and the DWR purchases that  have to be passed on to consumers)?   2) Since existing rates are predicated on the authorized return on the  underlying book value (is this number $1 billion?)? of the Transmission  assets, will the rates have to increase to cover the State's capital costs (I  am assuming that the State will have to pay "market value" for the purchase  of Transmission -- plus invest another $1 billion to eliminate congestion and  add transmission where it is needed) and the new administrative bureaucracy  to oversee their new assets.? Even with the State's lower cost of capital,  won't rates have to go up to pay off the bonds and pay salaries to the new  bureaucrats?? I am also assuming that the Democrats will not eliminate the  existing Union employee infrastructure of the utilities who will maintain the  system under contract to the State and will therefore not save any money on  O&M.   3) The State believes that purchase of the Transmission grid will remove FERC  "interference" and they can leverage their asset ownership to bring  generators to their knees.?? Is this a valid assumption?? Won't the State  have to comply with FERCs Order 888 requiring open  access/non-discrimination??? I assume the only relief from FERC oversight  will come in the form of no rate cases?? Who will oversee the economics of  the new Bureaucracy -- the CPUC -- not a chance?? The EOB?? The ISO?? The new  CUBA??? Will this new bureaucracy look and feel just like the ISO whose  ongoing costs of operation continue to spiral skyward???  4) Are there some potential benefits to State ownership of the Transmission  grid?? Will the State be capable of acting more quickly than the utilities  that would be forced to litigate potential transmission expansion before one  or more regulatory bodies before any project can go forward?? Is the State in  a better position to work with Transmission builders in Canada and Mexico to  coordinate the expansion of systems there?? Or, like Cal Trans, is the State  likely to be just as crippled as the utilities because they have their own  set of bureaucratic handcuffs that keep progress stifled and slowed?   5) If we are going to buy into the Governor's plan -- should we hold out for  reforms that will be needed to create viable retail competition?? I am told  that the reason the "no more direct access" provision was added to AB 1X, was  at the insistence of the Department of Finance.? Finance was afraid that DWR  would contract to buy firm energy for Californian's and they would abandon  the State in favor of a retail competitor.? One way to resolve this problem  is to require very large customers (could we define the criteria) to stay  with their retail competitor for a least 12 months so that DWR will have  ample opportunity to adjust their purchases to track the changes.? Without  viable retail competition the utilities must continue to suffer under  hindsight reasonableness reviews.? I believe, if customers (all customers  including residential) had viable retail alternatives, we could let the  utilities buy whatever they wanted and pass those costs through to their  customers with no regulatory oversight (no profit on generation sales).? If  the utilities retail generation costs get out of line with competitors'  offers, the customers will have the unfettered ability to switch.   "Gary, the only way we will be able to survive this next legislative  onslaught will be to fix what is wrong.? It will be impossible to derail the  train."   Jobs and People   I guess one of the low points this week was the letter a number of us  received from Green Mountain's Julie Blunden.? In her letter she says, "Most  of you aware of the profound changes that have occurred in California's  electricity markets and political stage over the past nine months. Those  changes have touched our customers, our partners and our team. I am writing  to tell you of my very difficult decision to leave Green Mountain Energy.  "As a result of the state of the market in California, our team out here will  need to reflect the lower level of market activity. At this time, it's  appropriate for me to move on to the next set of challenges. It has been my  privilege to work with my teammates in California and a pleasure watching our  company grow and attract a large set of talented people.   "I feel fortunate to be able to hand the baton to Rick Counihan.? I will be  working on the transition with Rick through March 16th. After that, you can  continue to reach me at 415-902-5313, or blunden@hotmail.com."   Julie, you will be missed. I first met you at a PUC all parties meeting with  Commissioner Conlon, way back in 1996, or so.? I can't remember the topic.?  At that meeting you where so soft spoken, but nevertheless forceful.? First  impressions being misleading, as always, I thought you were some kind of tree  hugger, if you know what I mean.? But over time I found your comments to be  truly insightful, meaningful, interesting, and relevant.? You are a leader,  and one of the few females, besides Avista's Linda Hamilton, who likes to  tour power plants.? I hope our professional paths cross again, soon.? Good  luck to you in all your endeavors.   Rob Lamkin of Mirant (used to be Southern Energy, but now you must learn how  to pronounce Mirant.? It sounds like mirror with an ant.) is searching  talented people.? Rob writes, "As you know, I am looking to hire a few  regulatory people.? Any suggestions?? Please post in the next Burrito."?  Done, buddy.? Rob's phone number is 925-287-3102, and his e-mail address is  rllamkin@seiworldwide.com .   Seth Wilson, formerly of the Cal PX is looking for employment.? He is an  excellent analyst, he has over 20 years experience in electricity and gas  market negotiating energy contracts, and energy risk management.? He has both  municipal and investor-owned utility experience in resource planning, asset  evaluation, load forecasting and demand-side management.? He is very  effective communicating at all management levels, and to present information  and recommendations to corporate officers, board members and regulators. I  would encourage anyone interested in talking to Seth to call him at (909)  653-6045 Cell: (626) 487-9046 <esethwilson@yahoo.com   Odds & Ends (_!_)   Paul Gribik, formerly of Perot Systems, and now a consultant with PA  Consulting handed me a great compliment.? He said the Friday Burrito was like  a breath of fresh air each week.? He also said the Burrito was like driving  on Highway 5 between the Grapevine and Stockton where the only relief from  the bleak landscape is the Harris Ranch.? The Burrito is the Harris Ranch.? I  asked Paul if he wasn,t confusing the Harris Ranch with the mountain of cow  crap (talk about a breath of fresh air) 10 miles north of the Harris Ranch in  Coalinga?? He said, no.? The sight and smell of the cow station only reminded  him of things going on in Sacramento.? Fair enough.   Sister Camden Collins clipped a good one from USA Today.? Check it out:   "It was reported in the USA Today that Governor Davis' secret weapon in the  design of these innovative solutions is Jerry Springer. There will be a Jerry  Springer show on the negotiations and resolutions later this month entitled  Politicians That Love Mud Wrestling with Themselves."   Finally, my bud from Modesto, Ken Weisel sent me this gem with which we will  close out the week.   What is electricity?   Today's scientific question is: What in the world is electricity? And where  does it go after it leaves the toaster?? Here is a simple experiment that  will teach you an important electrical? lesson:   On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach your hand into  a friend's mouth and touch one of his dental fillings.? Did you notice how  your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain?   This teaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force, but we must  never use it to hurt others unless we need to learn an important electrical  lesson.? It also teaches us how an electrical circuit works. When you scuffed  your feet, you picked up batches of "electrons," which are very small objects  that carpet manufacturers weave into carpet so that they will attract dirt.  The electrons travel through your bloodstream and collect in your finger,  where they form a spark that leaps to your friend's filling, then travels  down to his feet and back into the carpet, thus completing the circuit.   AMAZING ELECTRIC FACT: If you scuffed your feet long enough without touching  anything, you would build up so many electrons that your finger would  explode! But this is nothing to worry about unless you have carpeting.   Although we modern persons tend to take our electric lights, radios, mixers,  etc. for granted, hundreds of years ago people did not have any of these  things, which is just as well because there was no place to plug them in.  Then along came the first Electrical Pioneer, Benjamin Franklin, who flew a  kite in a lightning storm and received a serious electrical shock. This  proved that lightning was powered by the same force as carpets, but it also  damaged Franklin's brain so severely that he started speaking only in  incomprehensible maxims, such as, "A penny saved is a penny earned."  Eventually he had to be given a job running the post office.   After Franklin came a herd of Electrical Pioneers whose names have become  part of our electrical terminology: Myron Volt, Mary Louise Amp,? James Watt,  Bob Transformer, etc. These pioneers conducted many important electrical  experiments - Among them, Galvani discovered (this is the truth) that when he  attached two different kinds of metal to the leg of a frog, an electrical  current developed and the frog's leg kicked, even though it was no longer  attached to the frog, which was dead anyway. Galvani's discovery led to  enormous advances in the field of amphibian medicine. Today, skilled  veterinary surgeons can take a frog that has been seriously injured or  killed, implant pieces of metal in its muscles, and watch it hop back into  the pond just like a normal frog, except for the fact that it sinks like a  stone.   But the greatest Electrical Pioneer of them all was Thomas Edison, who was a  brilliant inventor despite the fact that he had little formal education and  lived in New Jersey. Edison's first major invention in 1877 was the  phonograph, which could soon be found in thousand of American homes, where it  basically sat until 1923, when the record was invented. But Edison's greatest  achievement came in 1879 when he invented the electric company.? Edison's  design was a brilliant adoption of the simple electrical circuit: The  electric company sends electricity through a wire to a customer, then  immediately gets the electricity back through another wire, then (this is the  brilliant part) sends it right back to the customer again.   This means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch of  electricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since very few  customers take the time to examine their electricity closely. In fact, the  last year any new electricity was generated was 1937; the electric companies  have been merely re-selling it ever since, which is why they have so much  time to apply for rate increases.   Today, thanks to men like Edison and Franklin, and frogs like Galvani's, we  receive almost unlimited benefits from electricity. For example, in the past  decade scientists have developed the laser, an electronic appliance, so  powerful that it can vaporize a bulldozer 2000 yards away, yet so precise  that doctors can use it to perform delicate operations to the human eyeball,  provided they remember to change the power setting from "Vaporize Bulldozer"  to "Delicate."   =========================  Okay, I've got my TV set tuned to "vaporize killer tomatoes".? Have a great  weekend.   gba  ?

Subject: ? ? ? ?Re: PACE presentation    Dave, Here is my response to the concerns raised in your e-mail below regarding exports from Ontario to the connected US markets:   ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?a) Remember that the rules and policies under development at the IMO will ensure that load in Ontario will not be cut in order to support export transactions (in other words, Ontario, like most US systems, has adopted a "native load" preference).   ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? b) Remember also that the Ontario market clearing price will be set by the offers and bids within Ontario. Scheduled external demand will move us up the bid stack but cannot, for instance, set the Ontario price by offering ?lets say ?$1,000 MWh. The price paid by all internal and external ?load (leaving aside the issue of congestion) will ? ?be set by the marginal bid in Ontario.   ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? c) Remember also that the scope for ?economic export transactions will be limited by the impact of the export and wheeling tariff ?($1 MWh), liability for uplift (estimated at approximately ?$4 ?MWh), and the IMO administration fee (estimated at $1MWh), ?plus any wheeling/admin charges applied by the connected markets.   ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? d) Perhaps most importantly, remember that congestion costs will be charged in respect of export transactions from the Ontario zone (assume low cost) to an external intertie zone (assume high cost). A buyer from the Ontario spot market in the external intertie zone will pay the aggregate of the Ontario market clearing price plus the applicable congestion costs. Those congestion costs are calculated as the difference between the Ontario price (low cost) and the price in the external zone (high cost). ?Two features/implications of this regime are worth noting. First, the liability to pay congestion costs will by itself reduce the scope for export transactions of the scope and level you fear. (Though one can buy transmission rights - TRs - which will provide a complete hedge against congestion costs.) ?Second, the congestion costs collected under this regime will, after funding the hedge held by the holders of TRs, be applied to reduce the revenue requirement of the transmission owners. ?(In other words, the surplus flows back to reduce the transmission rates that Ontario consumers would otherwise pay).   ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

Subject: ? ? Re: PACE  presentation        Aleck: ?Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. ?One point that I forgot to mention was the impact of external demand.   At the same time that Ontario generators would be trying to sell into higher priced US markets, marketers serving US customers would be trying to buy lower cost power in Ontario to ship south. ?As you pointed out, both groups would need to take into account the costs of wheeling and exporting the power. ?However, if the price differential between the Ontario and US markets was sufficient to offset these costs, electricity would flow to the US until the price differential for delivered power was eliminated. ?If demand exceeded supply in the US market by an amount equal to or larger than the US intertie capacity, and Ontario was the lowest-cost supply alternative, the total demand for Ontario power (from native and foreign sources) could exceed Ontario supply under extreme weather (as shown in the table below). ?Under these conditions, the price in Ontario would be bid up by the US market imbalance. ?Alberta would have had a similar problem with its BC intertie, if it hadn't decoupled its market pricing so that the market clearing price for Albertans is set only by local demand.   A second and perhaps more critical issue, is the technical capability of the Ontario market. ?Despite the rosy reports from the IMO, some market participants have experienced IMO failures during testing and most MEUs have indicated that they cannot be ready for a November opening. ?Many people feel that the risk of system failure must be eliminated or reduced to a manageable insignificant level, before the market can be opened.   I would appreciate any additional thoughts you care to share on these points.

Re: PACE presentation ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?12:27 PM         David, here are some observations in response to your questions: a) You are correct that we would expect Ontario-based generators to pursue economic export opportunities in the connected US markets but we stress that the economics of such exports will be affected not only by the comparative generation costs, but also the cost of Hydro One's export and wheeling tariff, the IMO uplift and related charges charged to all load (including exports), transmission costs in the connected market, and any congestion costs arising in the event that the intertie between Ontario and the connected market is congested. ?Everything else being equal, this means that on average, power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in the U S connected markets. b) With respect to volatility, it has to be conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities. Having said that, the period of most serious volatility is the summer months. Moreover, we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the decrease in fuel costs (i.e. natural gas prices) ?and extensive new generation build - PIRA estimates that in Summer 2001 the year to year increase in ?available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is about 30,000MW. This all adds up to increased price stability. ? Again, my colleague, Garrett Tripp, and I would be ready to meet with your group at any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail. ?Give me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points. ? 416 865 3707. ?Regards, Aleck      ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? david.matthews@cgc.en ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?bridge.com ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? To: Aleck.Dadson@enron.com ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? cc: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?06/13/2001 05:50 PM ? ? ? ? ?Subject: ? ? Re: PACE presentation        Thanks for the report. ?It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another California.   The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by imports, while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on higher-priced imports to meet demand. ? The first two points seem to contradict the results from the IMO test runs, which indicate that the US markets will set the clearing price in Ontario 90 percent of the time, putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market. ?If prices are higher in the adjacent markets, Ontario generators can be expected to export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the Ontario market, resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are determined on the margin. ?Price volatility and extreme price swings were also identified as concerns by MEUs.   Were any of these concerns addressed in your presentation and are there any comments you can share?

A significant aspect of the home  pages is the addition of content which will be developed at a desk and or  company level.  The content which we are adding will be much more dynamic and  require constant changes.  In this light we will need to develop an approval process which protects  Enron however does not completely impede our effort to provide current  interesting content on the web site.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Puget's 13 largest customers ;;;   Air Liquide et al v. PSE           Formal Complaint - Docket UE-001952           This week, the Commission is hearing evidence regarding the level of  a "soft         cap" on prices PSE charges some large customers.           On January 26, Public Counsel and Commission Staff filed a joint  answer on         the rate cap mechanism.           On Jan. 22, the UTC approved a temporary "soft-price" cap for power  rates         paid by 13 large industrial customers of Puget Sound Energy (PSE). A         short-term soft cap would allow PSE to charge above the cap for power  costs         if the utility was paying more than a maximum level.           The order calls for a second set of proceedings to establish the  level of the         temporary soft cap as a term under the provisions of Schedule 48 and  the         PSE/Georgia-Pacific Special Contract. The cap would be in place  pending         further proceedings to determine a final disposition of Schedule 48.           Puget's 13 large industrial customers are: Boeing, Georgia-Pacific,  Air Liquide         America Corp. CNC Containers, Equilon Enterprises, Air Products and         Chemicals, Inc., Tesoro Northwest, City of Anacortes, Intel Corp.,  King         County's Metro Wastewater Treatment Division, Olympic Pipe-Bayview,         Qwest and MCI WorldCo

Of course, we would only secure a plane if it is NOT needed for business  purposes that particular day and would be subject to company policy on all  charges.  No problem if this doesn't work!  Stan

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Vacation Request ;;;     Mr. Lavorato,    Hello.  Below are estimates on the vacation we discussed last week.  I  know that Jamaica was not a set destination but I really feel something  like the FDR Resort might be a good options for a family vacation.  One  of the biggest pluses is the nanny you are assigned upon arrival I think  most people find it really makes the vacation stress fee.  I will be  honest with you there are other resorts in the Caribbean that are nicer  but they are not family resorts.  Programs and things are offered for  children usually starting at 4 years (sometimes 3) of age nanny services  are not really provide and just babysitting that must be prearranged.  If  features like the nanny service are not as important to you then I will  make other suggestions.   I am not including rates on the Boscobel Beach  Resort because they just closed to do renovation that will last until  December 2001.  If you have any questions, need additional information,  or would like to set up reservations please do not hesitate to call or  E-mail.

This is causing  problems with the brokers clearing the trades on the NYMEX.  Per my voicemail  several weeks ago, since you/your desk are our communications guy with the  brokers,  they need to receive the notice as soon as possible.

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to  Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:  ? Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with  current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer) ? More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features ? Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices ? Instant Messaging capabilities  WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?  ? Email Messages.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Latest FERC data request ;;;   Randy, Becky and I just had a conference call with John Kroeger, attorney in  FERC's  Market Oversight and Enforcement Office, about the data request we  just received from them regarding gas deals into California for May 2001.  We  explained that the data request we just received was in many regards  identical to the one FERC staff sent us in December and which we answered in  January and we directed him to that response, both for the explanation of how  our business works and why we can therefore cannot answer the questions as  they were framed, and also for an example of what the data will look like for  the new time frame, if we submit it.  (We may have to file written consent  for Kroeger to review this previously filed data, which we agreed to do).   Mr. Kroeger stated they wanted the data request to be construed with common  sense (a refreshing notion).  He agreed that the"contracts" they want would  just be deal tickets for the applicable time frame.  He also indicated a  willingness to extend the time so that we can file information when we get it  in due course.  He will get back to us after he looks at the info already  filed in the SDG&E complaint.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Your Encouragement Would Be Appreciated ;;;   The Gas and Power Trading organizations have had a tremendous year.   Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization  that significantly contributed to that success.  I believe the Weather Group  comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from  Power are one of those groups.  These individuals have done a tremendous job  of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take.  The  greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast.   They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were  moderating.  On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve  an "A+".  When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would  stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our  success.   Thanks,  Jim Schwieger

Specifically,  1.  We need to document carefully the forces that were behind the original transformation of Enron.  Specifically, the fallout from deregulation (take or pay contract defaults, etc.), the impact of the losses from the oil trading operation, the nationalization of the Peruvian pipeline, and the leveraging up to fend off the Carl Ichan takeover attempt.  2.  We need to complete/beef up the network strategy section.  3.  Finally, the concluding section needs to be carefully crafted to "hammer home" the basic principles underlying the transformation.  What do you think?  Hope you have a great weekend.  John  John D. Martin Carr P.

In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit  and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any "  future California", we propose the following changes:  1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All  Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading  contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a  major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to  have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best  advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.  2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple  Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have  multiple masters with a counterparty, a "bridge" should be put place between  the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or  more masters.  3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging  EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient  from both a credit and legal point of view.  4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event --   Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts  or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes  will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity  to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve  Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is  conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity  and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Orders issued today in NYISO and ISO-NE proceedings ;;;   Today FERC issued the following draft orders:  NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.    NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.  NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made "but for" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.    ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.   If you need further information, please let me know.  Susan Lindberg x30596

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Park n Ride ;;;   Linda, I talked with Linda and Michelle this week on this issue. What Michelle  wanted to know  was does TW have Operators who have PNR agreements.  Currently, TW does not have any operators with PNR agreements because they  have mandatory OBAs on TW. With our 637 compliance filing TW is requesting  that Operators move their imbalance to a PNR if it is over a certin volume.  Also EOG does pool on TW so as a shipper we could get them to enter into a  PNR. They would need to have a shipper transport it to and from the PNR point. I also told Michelle that all points the flow any volumes on TW are required  to be an an OBA. Michelle said that they were able to resolve this issue with EOG.   Thanks Ramona

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: UK RPI model ;;;   Hi Zimin!  Please find attached for your  review the UK RPI model, derived by  bootstrapping RPI swaps.   It's a very simple model and here are its specifics:  SWAP STRUCTURE  Payment: semi/semi Act/365F The first payment is the latest known historical RPI, February 2000, 2.32%.   ASSUMPTIONS  * Constant cashflows between the quoted years (as opposed to interpolating  swaps which distorts the curve a lot). This explains the atrocious look of  the "raw" curve. It is then smoothed with a macro, which Anjam wrote.  * Mid point of the swaps is used for deriving the curve;  * Discount rate is LIBOR and I solve for the coupon rate, which is the RPI  YOY rate;    * The above is solved separately for each quoted period (e.g. 2 yrs, 5 yrs)  and RPI rates are determined for the incremental portion.  By forecasting RPI in the above method we are able to lock in and deliver the  forecasted levels.  Looking forward to your comments and seeing you in London!  Best regards,  Martina x34327

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: Draft Letter to Congress on Wynn Reliability Legislation ;;;   Rick:  unfortunately, the stand alone reliability legislation DOES have a  "reasonable chance of passing."  To block this possibility, we are pursuing  two strategies simultaneously.  #1 the Stakeholder letter with the message  that the bill does little for reliability and provides no real political  inoculation so should not be passed; and #2 the lack of consensus on the  technical language contained within the bill makes passage problematic.  If  the bill were to be able to move, the bill must be considered "consensus"  otherwise it  will pose political problems for the Calendar.  Today, there is  still lack of bill consensus.  We should consider a strategy of asking for  reasonable legislative provisions beyond the current language which would  improve the bill (and continue to keep true consensus from occurring.)  Of  course, we cannot be obvious on this approach.    Part of the reason I was pushing to get one or our CEO's to play golf with  Congressman Tauzin on the 22nd is he is the key Member pushing the House  Leadership to pass the stand-alone bill now to "politically inoculate  Republicans."  As the likely new House Commerce Committee Chairman; he  carries sway.  Another approach would be for us to call Entergy to give  Congressman Tauzin the same message.  And our #3 strategy.....pray that the temperature cools down so the issue  dissipates.....and/or they run out of time......     Richard Shapiro@EES 08/10/2000 09:16 AM

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Benefits Questions ;;;   Teresa: As I indicated in my voice mail message I have the following questions about  the maternity leave policy:  1. I am assuming that any vacation time that I still have left I can use up  at 100% pay.  2. My understanding is that in order to go beyond the 6 week period I would  need a letter from my doctor indicating the medical condition that exists and  justifying sick leave pay at 90%  3. If I want to take after the 6 week period an unpaid leave of absence,  whose approval do I need?  Does unpaid leave affect any of my current  benefits (i.e., options that are due to vest, medical, parking etc.)  If I am  on unpaid leave and Enron offers a stock option program at year end, am I  still eligible?  I will contact Carmen about the forms that I need to fill out.  Please let me  know if you are not the right person to answer these questions.  I am  scheduled to meet with mark haedicke tomorrow afternoon at 2 to go over my  plans.        Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

Likely in response to the A/BC border constraint that began Thursday due to  maintenance on the TransCanada-British Columbia Line, NOVA changed its  imbalance tolerance range to +2%/-18% Wednesday. Reflecting the resultant  shift in supply accessibility, neighboring Westcoast has a +20%/0% tolerance  in effect.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales ;;;   Erik Runstrom 2725 Rochdale Ct Fort Collins, CO 80525 ERUN@WEBACCESS.NET  To Mr. Ken Lay,  I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.  Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.  The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.  Sincerely,  Erik Runstrom

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Enron Center Garage ;;;   The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.  Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new  building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being  offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.  This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the  new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The  cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is  currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly  employee cost of $94.00.  If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to  the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made  as spaces become available.   The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be  opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street  level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available.  Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an  exit in the event of elevator trouble.   If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to  Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your  email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and  receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new  garage.  The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and  Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.   (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians,  will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Internal Markets ;;;   Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.  I  think it works welll in allocating resources between competing "going  concerns" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new  businesses  that may not have the income to fund the best talent.  I also wonder if the  cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than  the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.  In its own often  clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly  effectively.  Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of  time on this.  Regards Delainey

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: US FERC Chairman Vows Action By Dec On Western Pwr Woes ;;;   US FERC Chairman Vows Action By Dec On Western Pwr Woes ?  10/05/2000  Dow Jones Energy Service  (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will  act no later than December in response to power capacity and volatility  problems that plagued Western power markets this year, Chairman James Hoecker  said Thursday.  Hoecker, after appearing before the Senate Energy Committee, told reporters  that he expected the results of an expedited staff investigation of the  matter to be forwarded to the commission before the month is out.  The commission will "take serious action" in response to the staff report  "before the holidays," he said, without elaborating.  Before the panel, Hoecker said he expected the commission to act in response  to the staff's nationwide probe of problems besetting competitive wholesale  markets before the end of this year. The staff report on the nationwide  investigation is due Nov. 1.  In meeting with reporters after the hearing, Hoecker appeared to indicate  that the response to the Western market woes could come sooner than December.  Hoecker outlined the tentative timetable after the Senate hearing into  concerns the Pacific Northwest is becoming increasingly prone to power supply  shortages in the coming years.  The Northwest Power Planning Council projects that by 2003 the regions runs a  one in four risk of a power shortage - and resulting grid blackouts or  brownouts - during peak summer and winter demand periods as demand outstrips  supply.  In order to lessen that 25% risk to an acceptable 5%, the council determined  the region would need an additional 3,000 megawatts of new generation  capacity, either installed or imported from elsewhere.  The hearing featured testimony from the Bonneville Power Administration and  others regarding how California's grid capacity problems this summer have had  an adverse affect on the region in terms of price volatility.  Prepared testimony from BPA featured a graph illustrating that the region's  spot market prices during the two years prior to California's power market  restructuring never exceeded $50 per megawatt-hour, and typically were well  below that level.  Since the California power exchange began operating in May 1998, spot market  volatility markedly increased into a price spike this summer in excess of  $200 per megawatt-hour.  But another key factor in the Pacific Northwest's problems was dry weather  that depressed available hydropower generation from the region's massive  complex of federally owned dams, said Stephen Oliver, BPA's vice president of  bulk power marketing and transmission services.  The difference between a wet year and a dry year is 5,000 megawatts of power  generation capacity, Oliver told the committee.  Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who chaired the hearing, elicited from Oliver  that operational changes mandated to aid migration of salmon and other  endangered fish cost the system another 1,000 megawatts of capacity.  "At this point, the pricing problems in California and the Northwest appear  to be related," he said, citing near-record warm weather in the region and  lower-than normal hydropower availability.  Additionally, Hoecker attributed the region's price volatility to  California's "very high reliance on the spot market."  The supplies of power in the U.S. West are "simply inadequate," Hoecker said.  The picture painted by the hearing testimony served in contrast to the  "rumbling" of officials in California that imports of federal hydropower from  the Pacific Northwest were contributing to California's market problems,  noted Sen. Gordon Smith R-Ore.  "It is the structure of (California's) market that has created the problem,"  said Smith, noting, too, that the state's discouragement of new power plant  capacity has contributed to the problem.  "It looks like the markets have gone haywire," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,  who attributed the problems to deregulated power markets. He vowed to fight  any congressional deregulation legislation that threatens to raise power  costs in the Pacific Northwest.  -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; bryan.lee@dowjones.com

Along with the below mentioned items from Ben, we also need  All Accums, (previous and current  mmbtu and mmcf), All Flows both MMbtu and MMcf. on all runs, 2" rotary, 4" turbine meter, 10" ultra-sonic. All available History info..  This information request is for monitoring TW and El Paso at the Griffith Site. Gary, Steve, Dale please review and if you think we need anything else, now is the time to speak up.  We need as much information as possible to insure a smooth transition for gas control.  From what TW is  hearing we could take over the operation sometime next week.   Dale once we have the additional requests, will you foward them to Ben or would you like me to.  I will be  glad to help.    DS
__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Sweetgum/ENA ;;;   I have not yet received all of InterGen's comments on the documents, however, to expedite matters, I am passing on some additional comments on the letter agreements and the form of Facility Agreement to be attached to the letter agreements.  Letter Agreements:  Sections 3(a) and 3.(b) of all three letter agreements should be revised as noted in the attached form of letter agreement.  Facility Agreements:  1.  The second sentence of Section 17.4.1 of each of the Facility Agreements should be amended to read as follows:  "If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value the difference between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Refund Amount") shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4 below."  This is the same comment I made earlier.  2.  Exhibits B-1 and H-2 are blank and the corresponding exhibits from the master GE sales agreement should be attached to the Facility Agreement.  3.  The cross-reference to Exhibit N-1 should be deleted from Exhibit I as Exhibit N-1 was deleted from the Facility Agreement.  4.  Exhibit R is blank, however, it is unclear whether this Exhibit is still relevant.  5.  Exhibit U appears to be incomplete and the reference back to Section 10.8.4 is unclear.  I believe Tom Seigler brought this up point up with Ben before Coral left the proposed transaction.  6.  The references throughout the Exhibits to "oF" should be corrected to contain the degree symbol.   - 5wtmq03_.DOC

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Four New Graphs ;;;   Sally,   While I think it makes sense for this type of information to be available,  that it should be done by Operations, and that Eugenio has the skills and  knowledge to articulate it well, I have some concerns.   First and foremost,  the process of creating a standard risk metric belongs to RAC, I believe.  To  me this is no different than VAR, or the Capital Pricing methodololgy, or the  RAROC process.   This has been published without even a review from our  group, which I think is inappropriate for two reasons: 1) we might disagree  and, as stated above, I think we have the final say, and 2) we can't quality  control it and all the reciepients think that I have.  Second, this has been  developed in isolation when in fact we have been doing similar things for the  past 2 years. We report these to the Board and have published to the Desk  heads on a monthly basis returns by trader.  Clearly, there could have been  some benefit in each direction if we were told that this was a goal of this  group, particularly when we fundamentally agree that this group should be  doing these things.  Thirdly, it is a little irritating when someone sets up  a process in isolation for what may appear to be "show-time" when my group is  spending hours and hours analyzing the output of existing process because the  data integrity is so bad (double mapping of portfolios, books not  officialized......) - we have at least attempted to take both parts of the  equation, Eugenio has chosen to focus on the cool part.  Now I would be a  little less concerned if on almost every day, Eugenio wasn't in my morning  meeting contributing virtually nothing, i.e., this doesn't appear to be  oversight on his part.  I would prefer to not make a big deal out of this, but rather take it as an  opportunity to clarify and shift some responsibilities.  In the big scheme of  things it is a move in the right direction.  Penny for your thoughts Ted

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: Additional Budget Authorization Request ;;;   Scott, I received your attached letter reflecting your "out-of-scope" expenditure for the fatal flaw analysis.  I am amazed that you spent $10,000.00 more than you were authorized (authorized amount $8,500.00).  I have passed along your invoice for the contracted $8,500.00 to our development group and at present have no authorization to approve any amount over that commitment.  When the Commercial guys have contracts with shippers and we are ready to move ahead on the environmental resource reports for the FERC filing, we can talk about the overage at that time.  However, I am not sure recovery will be possible.  Until then, I'm afraid I have no further authorization.  John Shafer

We have taken your feedback from the  survey as well as added additional functionality that will enhance the  effectiveness.   Below is a list of the new functionality & features:  * Created a new graphical design with multiple pages using 'tabs' to organize  the information better  * Created a tab labeled 'My Pipeline' for you to customize with the  categories of your choice * Added a specific tab for NNG as well as the ability to add multiple  pipelines in the future * Additional business and market intelligence categories have been added  through secondary tabs * Created an Alert bar to allow you to identify specific conditions to notify  you through the Dashboard * Ability to add security to individual categories on the portal  Here are a few simple steps to take to access the new site:  1) From Internet Explorer 5.0, enter the link below or click on it here to  access:  http://nahou-wwrms02p.ets.enron.com/  2) You will be required to put in a new I.D. and password - the ID &  passwords are the same as your LAN id:   * It is the initial of your first name followed by seven digits of your last  name   (ex. mjanouse for both ID & password)  3) The new Dashboard will appear with defaults in each tab:   * You can then customize according to your needs and interests.  * The default will prompt you to the 'My Pipeline' tab;   - This tab contains categories from the NNG tab but with personalization  features   - You can remove categories from here if you do not use them in your  day-to-day  * The NNG tab is the replication of most of the categories from our current  Dashboard:   -  Some categories have been moved to other tabs.   (ex. Weather )  * To save this new Dashboard as your 'homepage', please do the following:   - Go to the top right utility navigation bar which says 'set as your  homepage'    - Click on it and then when the window comes up for verification, click OK   - Now, when you log on to your PC, click on the IE5 symbol    - Please delete current shortcut on your desktop to old Dashboard   Here are a few notes and helpful hints to make your dashboard experience a  joyful one:  Favorites -  Favorites are now called links and are available in the upper  right content of each tab.  You can create as many link categories as you  like and you may now group similar links by entering a custom title when you  edit your list. Memo -  The Memo pad allows you to jot yourself a note without leaving the  dashboard.  You can create as many memo pads as you like.    If you have any other questions, please call Bobby Mason at x3-5196 or myself  at x3-7275.   Thanks!!

That's what I will remember about him  most.      Margaret Jones <mjones@gc.edu> on 02/02/2001 10:59:25 AM

As expected, the Senate Revenue and Tax Committe voted out SB1X, the Windfall Tax Bill (see attached bill language).  While the co-author noted it was a "work in progress," he noted that he envisioned a program wherein 150% of the existing corporate rate would apply to the "excess profits." This approach would result in a tax rate of approximately 13.5 percent applied to the "excess proftis."  IEP testified against the bill (see attached IEP letter opposing the bill). In response to questions, the author indicated the intent was not to "go after QFs", but he also presumed that QFs were not receiving "gross profits."  Questions left unanswered included:  would the tax apply to municipal entities; how would the tax apply to out-of-state entities; what would be the impact on system sales and reliability;  what would be the impact on incentives for new development.  The bill is expected to move to the Senate Appropriations Committee. However, the Appropriations Committee is not expected to take the bill up this week, and the members apparently are still planning on taking a recess next week.

I really would love to work in the Research Group and am sincere about this. I would just hope that you would consider compensating me at manager level so that I can cover transportation, accomodation expenses and more importantly, justify the decision to devote at least half of my time to Enron away from my thesis.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Meter 984229 - Roos Common Point - Trade Zone 18 ;;;   Vance:  Per our conversation, we have two possible options to resolve this deal,  depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not.  Producing:  If that is the case, the purchase from Calpine, and any contracts  hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level.   Once that is done, I will need to research in the system how those wellheads  were allocated and paid and reallocate to your Calpine deal.  This will  probably have to go back to HPLC's ownership of HPLR's gathering assets.  Non-producing:  Should we determine that the Common Point and any wells  behind it have been shut-in, or P&A'd, we will need to reallocate this deal  to zero, and unwind any hedges against it (or, move the hedges to another  deal, if possible.  Since the deal is older, we probably sold lower priced  contracts against the production and a buy-back today would possibly result  in a financial loss).    In either case, the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow  at meter 4229, which I am currently looking into.  I will email you as soon  as I ascertain that date.  In lieu of the past couple of days, we may need to look at all of the deals  which were impacted by HPLC's aquisition of HPLR's gathering to ensure that  they are being captured properly, both at a book level and at a state filing  level.  Please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish  this.  Thank you again for all of your hard work in this area,    Mary

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western Electric Situation ;;;   I was at the Senate hearing today on FERC's market Monitoring and Mitigation  order, and I would add only a few additional and interesting  regulatory-related details to John's fine summary:  The hearing was contentious- among the Senators themselves, among the FERC  Commissioners themselves, and the interchanges between them.  Gas prices were controversial.  Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussion  on this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of $10, when it  was less than a dollar in other areas.  He then noted that the high gas cost  would adversely affect the power price under the auction, and that FERC must  act regarding the high transport differentials- "We will never get a handle  on electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices".  That opened the  floodgates of discussion, culminating with the announcement by Commissioner  Breathitt of FERC's technical conference (notice of which issued today) on  the topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity, and adequacy  of infrastructure within CA.  She said that this would shed light on basis  differentials and gas prices.  Freudian slip?  Chairman Hebert was heard to say by various attendees that  price mitigation in the WSCC would apply at all times (in contrast to the  order, which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach/fall  below 7%).  Whether he mis-spoke, or not, remains to be seen.    Regarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in CA (i.e.,  Stages 1, 2 or 3):  Hebert opined "Most of the time".  Breathitt said "Likely 80-85% of the time".  Massey was unconvinced.  Several Senators railed at the Commission for "not doing its job" and  threatened that if the Commission did not act, Congress would act.  If you have any questions or need additional detail, please feel free to  call.  Ray

The Eurelectric trip to the US (including their visit to Enron building in  Houston) has been rather fruitful - attched is the report Eurelectric  delegates put together upon their return from States and the slides from the  presentation they made in Brussels for the Commission and Members of the  European Parliament. Also attached is the memorandum from the European  Commission on the Californian crisis. The bottomline message is that  liberalisation process is not to be blamed for what happened in CA but rather  a set of very complex conditions. Also, the Commission tried to highlight  that a similar situation is highly unlikely to be reproduced in the European  Member States.    Nailia

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Desk-to-Desk v. Cross-Portfolio ;;;   I'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is  referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward  obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application  issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on  for the past few weeks.   Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own  desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is  possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all.  Am I missing something?  As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to  properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we  simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if  this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do  their jobs - do you know anything about that?  I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised.  Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in  any way.  Thanks, Kate

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: ERCOT - Problems with the New Market ;;;   We do need a formal plan.  We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions. Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information.  We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution. The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue, providing specific examples and proposing the solution.  Grand-standing is ignored.  Those who show up with complaints but cannot point to specifics are virtually ignored.  Those who show up and complain, but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls, board meetings, etc. are ignored.     Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations.  Thane and I also visited with him.   Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed.  (Even though he has bigger things to do in D.C., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas, the repercussions could be global.)    Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens (of the Texas legislature) are also engaged in market developments.  We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised.  There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th.  The forum is expected to be invited testimony only.  Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot's Sam Jones and Tom Noel.  The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom.  Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt. Governor, there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions.     Thane is in Austin on Friday, but is available by phone.  I will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m. Can we find another time that works for us to meet? Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9:30 until 3:00.  I am available after Rick's Friday budget meeting...are you available then?  You are right, we do need a formal plan, Thane has started an initial draft.  Thanks, Jean         From:	James D Steffes/ENRON@enronXgate on 08/01/2001 06:52 AM To:	Jean Ryall/NA/Enron@ENRON, Thane Twiggs/ENRON@enronXgate cc:	Doug Gilbert-Smith/ENRON@enronXgate, Richard Shapiro/ENRON@enronXgate   Subject:	ERCOT - Problems with the New Market  Jean & Thane --  Walking out last night, Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets.    Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes.    If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood.  As important, the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market.  Let's get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference.  Jean and Thane, I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation.  I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am.  I am free at 8am on Friday before Rick's budget meeting.  Jim

GDF attendees will receive a Welcome Package to include a color bound copy of  the presentation, Note pad, Enron Profile and Enron Annual Report.  Lastly: Restatement of Briefing Objectives and Theme  Purpose of the Visit: For Gaz de France -  To develop some insight in to what a competitive market place may mean for  their domestic operations.  They want to learn from Enron's gas deregulation  experiences.    For Enron -  Educate them on Enron's gas deregulation experiences and the outcome of the  U.S. gas pipeline restructuring. Help them to understand why they should embrace open access in order to help  speed up open access in France.  Enron Messages: Overall Message: Incumbent utilities with the right (progressive) approach can not only  survive but thrive under an open access regime.  The way to win is not by  dragging your feet and trying to protect historical markets but embracing the  change.   Prior to open access Emphasis on how bad things were prior to open access (the market moved from  surplus to shortage/major commodity price swings and exposure to price risk) After open access Enron (even our regulated businesses) grew dramatically because the company  embraced open access (throughput increased 40 to 50% w/o pipeline expansion) Enron treated the transport business like a business, viewing producers and  marketers as customers.   Thanks for your participation and contribution. See ya there. - Carrie http://experience.enron.com

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: DMS # 5618 Texas-New Mexico 11/16/00 ;;;   Dear Mark,  Can you look at deal # 460097, sale of 45 or 50 (??) MW to Texas-New Mexico  on 11/16/00 at HE7 for $125.00.  EnPower, the El Paso Model, and Unit Status all say that this deal was at 50  MWh's, HOWEVER, you have put a note in the El Paso Model that states that El  Paso is claiming that it's only 45 MW (no other comments).  I have a dispute  here from El Paso who, on the back end, is saying that the deal was only for  45MWs.  I'm assuming that the deal was actually 50MWs and that's why you left  our systems at 50MW and just made a note.  Please advise me on what I need to  tell Houston Settlements so we can get paid on this.  Thanks,   Virginia  x8981

Per Chris Foster, if we decide to sell any of the gen schedules real time we  only do it for a couple of hours at a time. That way when we see that the ISO  cuts the exports we can immediately cut the gen schedule.  This is the way I  was told to proceed in these cases in the future.

If it met deal criteria  and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that  would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in  economics and of course a skim.   Lets review presentation, then discuss with Ben/Andy and Janet D.  and  proceed to banks. Ben is clearing idea with Delaney. We are shooting for a  Friday (23) meeting.  Thanks, Rick

Printer-friendly version     By Jason Leopold   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES    LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to  order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis  claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May  2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show.   Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from  the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC  lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent  System Operator.       That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could  potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks.   Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in  unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC  administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will  likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis  expects.   Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., "with one goal,  and that is to bring back $9 billion."   Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO  documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,  for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October.   David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general  manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but  conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO.   Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork  for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from  corporate energy suppliers.   But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press  secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about  getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated  by FERC.   Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators  overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds.   State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation  into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on "shaky  calculations."   To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices  received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been  expected under competitive market conditions.   The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at  times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices  in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with  air-quality rules.   The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern  border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the  fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity.   The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's "Big Five" power  suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the  conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents.   The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest  utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid  operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the  documents.   The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed  amounts between May 2000 and February:

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: ;;;   Good to hear that you're still alive and kicking after your recent world travels.  You're right about GW -- it wasn't pretty getting there and the big question will be whether he made himself so ugly that he's too damaged for November. Honestly, I'm extremely disappointed in a number of ways with the campaign he's run and especially with some tactical decisions made by Karl and the rest of the staff who I don't think have served him particularly well. We'll see if they learned any lessons.  My other buddy, Rick Perry, is going to be in NYC at the end of the month and I'm helping to raise money for the event. I can't escape.  Excellent choice for vacation. You all will love it. Not only is it great for us adults, I think your girls will really enjoy it as well. The one thing I would recommend (before I bring in my file and bore you with too much) is to try and stay in one or maybe two places and not move to different hotels. It's easy to do day trips via car or train and it's great to come back to the same place. Granted, we were there for two weeks and were staying at a beautiful hillside, 5 bedroom villa with a pool, but it gives you more flexibility in your schedule, i.e. if you want to take it easy one day and just walk around the town you're in and have a leisurely lunch. Off the top of my head (and I will bring in my file) my favorite places were some of the obvious such as Florence which is good for at least one if not two full days and Siena, where Sue Mara and her family were there for the famous horse races in the city square, but also some of the smaller towns were just as interesting. San Gimignano is famous for its towers that rise out of the landscape, sort of like the Houston skyline, and do a day bike ride through the Chianti region and hit at least one winery. We did one around Montepulciano where we stopped for lunch. There are bike tour groups that will arrange all of it for you. I would also make the effort to go to the Tuscan coast and specifically Portifino, one of the most beautiful ports I've ever seen. And then if you're kids aren't susceptible to car sickness, I would do the drive along the Chicutira (sp?) coast which is a series of little fishing villages. This is probably more than you ever wanted to know, but the more familiar you are with the area before you go over there, the smoother it will be so I also recommend buying a Fodders, or whatever it's called. They're well worth it. Also be forewarned that if you rent a car, they are very small. Fortunately, the Kean family is also small.  Job is going great and settling into big city life very smoothly. Our stock has been taking a beating thanks in part to your guy, Clinton, and his interventionists statements that erased $50 billion from the biotech sector in one day last week. But we'll make up for it when we roll out our cure.  Call if you're up this way. Greetings to everyone on the floor.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Korea LNG opportunities ;;;   Darrell,  I attempted to call you a few minutes ago (late night your time - but there  was no voicemail).  I didn't want to wait several more days before I contact  you.  I'm out all weekend.  Eric shared with me some of your concerns about resources for a Korea LNG  opportunity.  I certainly understand your view but wanted to share some of my  thoughts.  Rick and/or Clay know the Asian LNG industry better than anyone  else in the company.  They are very good and I have a lot of faith in them  and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects.  They are  lacking wholesale type of transaction experience that a few of the guys that  have recently come into the group have.  That is why we have brought them  in.   We have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot.    Eric is the person we chose to run the group for many reasons but it wasn't'  done as a lack of faith in Rick or his original team.  The biggest  opportunities and the viewpoint we must take in this business is running it  like a wholesale unit and running it as a portfolio of transactions and  books.  That certainly doesn't  mean that 20 years of experience doesn't have  enormous value especially in the non-Atlantic markets.  Rick is in the  process of coming back to Houston after the shut down of our middle east  projects and strategy.  Rick is also in the process of assessing what exactly  he would like to do in the time of transition.  My very sincere hope is that  he will stay in the LNG group and perform a very important role especially in  this type of development or deal making role.  Especially  in a big deal in  Japan, Korea or something in the Asian area.  We will discuss this next week  when he comes to town.    I need Eric to be in Houston right now due to our Elba Island, Venezuela and  Bahamas immediate activity.  He will certainly be engaged in everything but  he can not be focuses as much as you need in Korea or Joe needs in Japan.  Please give me a call next week and we can discuss this in more detail.  Thanks, mike   PS - Frevert also likes this role for Rick.  Also the Eric specific head role  has not been officially announced yet.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Memo to RAC ;;;   I want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times. Lots of our efforts in the past building systems, procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these. Feedback from both Citibank and JPM/Chase and Enron's Board members has been very positive relative to RAC. Congratulations to all.  On another note I want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups, especially more junior members of these groups. Because they come from RAC they are not considered idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these people. We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.  Things are not back to normal but they are improving. Upon receipt of commitment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term issues should be resolved. Lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions. In the mean time, keep smiling.  Rick

If it is OK, I would like to offer COBRA costs of $7500 gross (current expenses for benefits are about $700).  Is this OK?

Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal. Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.  We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.  Best, Jeff

This is why I generated an early e-mail   on the Gaza project.  I am now trying to meet with my new team members, and   clients/customers in the organisation.  I am headed to Houston on Sunday, for   3 days of meetings, and first week of March begin a journey that will take me   to most parts of East Asia/Australia.  Any suggestions on how (where) we get   together, and do you think it is a high priority, or not urgent.  It is not   that I am looking to avoid a trip, but e-mails like those below suggest that   I can be kept well-informed without flying somewhere just to say "hello".  I   know Mac is in Dubai.  I can fly there, or you can come to London (or are   there others I should also meet in Dubai?).  Andrew - where are you based?    If in Dubai, then does it make sense for me to come to you?  Sooner rather   than later, or no urgency?  If in Houston, should we try to meet next week?    Or are you in still some other location?  Your thoughts/views are   appreciated.  thanks  mcs        Andrew Makk@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT    09/02/2000 17:03

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: SWPC Transfer ;;;   Don -  Please forward on to Allegheny.  In order to facilitate the smooth transfer of the assets, to close out the  turbine purchase contracts, and to provide Allegheny with unused generation  capability at Gleason, we are entering into an agreement with Siemens  Westinghouse Power Corp ("SWPC") which will effect the Gleason and Wheatland  facilities in the following way.  1.  Increase the permissible power level at Gleason on each of the turbines  from 182mw to 185mw.  Specifically, SWPC will allow the three Gleason units  to each have a maximum operating capability of 185,000kw and will reset the  control curves accordingly.  SWPC further will agree that operation of the  Gleason units up to and including 185,000 kw is within normal operating  parameters and operation up to and including this level will not invalidate  the warranty.  SWPC has agreed to make this change within one week after we  give them authorization.  2.  SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated  warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or  in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the  Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that SWPC's consent to such assignments  will not be unreasonably withheld.  SWPC will honor warranty claims currently  outstanding or asserted in the future by the contract assignee, assuming such  assignment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Gleason and  Wheatland contracts.  3.  SWPC agrees to assist Enron in providing technical information, including  redacted copies of the purchase contracts, applicable technical bulletins,  etc. to Allegheny.  This information will be limited to information which is  currently available to Enron and of a technical nature only.  I believe all of these features are significantly beneficial to Allegheny.   Please ask Allegheny for feedback, as we will be entering into the agreement  by the end of the week.  Regards,  Mitch Robinson

If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.          As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                     This creates a shortage in later months.   2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                         Specific questions should include:      1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage?    2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system.          I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less.   3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating  rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market  and the       consumer has benefitted.     Call me if you need any more input.   Phillip

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Committee conference call ;;;   The committee had a lengthy conference call today.  Let me touch on key topics.  First, the application to employ PriceWaterhouse is being contested by both the debtor and the US trustee.  There was a meeting today with the debtor to narrow differences.  The debtor will provide a list of its key concerns and we'll see if we can deal with them.  The UST just believes that there is too much of a chance of conflict between roles in the two cases.  We'll be setting a hearing soon to get the issue resolved on way or the other.  Second, PGE has sought broad discovery from PX not only of individual participants' claims against PGE but also underlying trading information.  PX contends that much of this information cannot be disclosed under the tariffs.  For that reason, PX hasn't even kprovided this information to its participants.  Eisenberg is opposing the discovery for that reason as well as based on burden to the debtor.  The PX committee feels that Montali will accomodate discovery, at least to some extent. Therefore, in the meet and confer this afternoon, the committee probably will support disclosure if (1) participants get whatever of their information as is disclosed to PGE, (2) substantial limitations are imposed on the parties that will have access to the information and the use to which it can be put and (3) PGE reimburses PX for a part of the cost.  In addition, the committee intends to file a motion in the PX case requesting that the debtor be ordered to turn information over to individual participants and to our accountants who will have the responsibility to test numbers but not to make general disclosure of accounts of individual participants.  Third, Howard Weg believes that without some agreement on the chargeback issue, FERC will take a long time to rule on whether PX should return collateral.  Accordingly, Weg wants the participants to come to an agreement that for any specified period, shortfalls will be shared prorata among participants.  I asked Weg to send an email out to committee members describing in detail his proposal and the basis for it so that we could discuss it in detail during our next call.  Fourth, the commandeering matters are proceeding.  The committee will complete interviews of prospective counsel next Monday.  In the meantime, the Victims Compensation Claims Board should rule June 22.  A summary denial is expected. Interestingly, only about 30% of the participants submitted claims to the board.  PX's expert opinion was made available to the committee.  He fixes the value of commandeered contracts at $1.060 billion minus $350 million of contract prices for a loss of just under $700 million.  We are following up to test these numbers.  The committee's counsel has been negotiating a stipulation for relief from stay in the PGE case.  It's moving too slowly, so our counsel is drafting a stay relief motion for our review.  No one seems inclined to start a commandeering suit until relief is granted. Fifth, our counsel is having second thoughts about a stipulation with Edison that would address the bond, the force majeur litigation and related matters.  The question that is under review is whether the proposed deal could be unwound if SCE files its own cha;pter 11 case.  On force majeur, Judge Montali apparently rejected PGE's argument on that point.  Sixth, there is still no deal with the trade creditors' committee.  They want about double the $4 million we're offering.  We expect any day a motion to extend plan exclusivity by the debtor.  Seventh, we discussed some committee representation issues.  The committee voted against adding Puget Sound as a member.  The committee agreed that it represented those who had claims based on the scheduling coordinator role performed by PX for ISO. The committee discussed whether it represented IOU's and concluded that it did if they were owed in their role as sellers to the PX.  Finally, the next meeting was set at 10 pst on June 25.  Feel free to call if there are questions.  Bob Nelson

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Legislators' "Plan B" to "Enhance" Governor's MOU w/Edison and Status Report ;;;   "Plan B" As folks know, there's a group of moderate Democrats in the CA Assembly that  has been working on a "Plan B." They've been working on it because they're not satisfied with the Governor's  MOU with Edison. The Plan B group has been talking to a broad array of stakeholders, including  Republicans, to get input into how "Plan B" can improve upon the MOU. First the good news about Plan B:  a fairly bright group of legislators is  rolling up its sleeves and attempting to come up with a centrist solution to  the problem, and they're at least creating the appearance of trying to be  bi-partison about it.  (There is at least one idea in Plan B that is  attributable to a Republican--Keith Richman--that Ken Lay met with a couple  of weeks ago.) So the beginnings of a process to resolve California's crisis  may be emerging. Now the bad news:  because they are trying to build a consensus, Plan B is a  mish-mash, isn't focused, includes some pretty bad ideas, excludes some good  ideas (like re-establishing Direct Access immediately), and is going to  require a lot more work to get right. Update on Efforts to Achieve a Settlement In the meeting with the suppliers that Steve Kean and I participated in  yesterday, one of the financial consultants hired by the Governor criticized  several of the Plan B proposals as unworkable. On today's call with the Governor's staff and suppliers it became somewhat  apparent that the Governor isn't going drive a resolution, but will leave it  to the Legislature to take the lead role. The staff emphasized repeatedly that the lawsuits, investigations, etc. were  not on the table for discussion in any global settlement talks, and that  attempting to bring them in to the negotiations was a nonstarter. Instead, the Governor's staff said that the group should focus on the size of  the discount that suppliers would be willing to take. The suppliers pushed back, stating that including haircuts in the talks while  excluding the lawsuits, investigations, etc. is one-sided and unworkable. The staff urged the group to begin negotiations with the Legislature, but  made it fairly clear that the Governor would not be the one to pull the  necessary principals together in a room to hammer out a solution; his staff  implied instead that it's up to others, i.e., the suppliers, to get the  process of negotiations underway. Next Steps If the Governor's financial consultants are prepared by Friday, they will  brief suppliers on the ways in which the administration is attempting to  resolve the State's creditworthiness issue to encourage suppliers to do power  deals with CDWR.  It they are not ready by Friday, the suppliers will meet  separately to discuss next steps. Finally, there's been some confusion.  My apologies.   Sandi faxed to Jim and Harry yesterday a copy of "Plan B."  Sandi mentioned  that the Governor gave the Plan B group an analysis of the Plan.  For those  that have a copy of Plan B, see the 10-page memo dated May 12th, attached to  the back of the Plan.  The memo is from Joe Fichera to John Dutra, Fred  Keeley and Joe Nation (3 of the Plan B Democratic legislators).  Joe Fichera  is the head of Saber Partners, a financial consulting group that the Governor  hired to advise him on the crisis.   If anyone has not yet received a copy of Plan B, please let me know and I'll  get it to you.  Best, Jeff

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Power Outage at Enron Building ;;;   Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.  Enron Property & Services Corp

Here's a quick update:  Maria, located the missing "DRI Operating" agreements and correspondence.  See the fax I sent to your computer.  The bad news, it is a 1 year, evergreen agreement with 60 days notice by either party prior to the end of the contract year (i.e. 60 days notice prior to October 31, 2002) to terminate.  Looks like paying them for post petition gas and reject the contract may be the best answer for the estate.  She also uncovered another listing of global contract numbers that may be the key to finding the other missing agreements in LiveLink.  Chris, has been reviewing Wade's TCO data and comparing it to pipeline gathering invoices.  I can't answer your question about whether we are making money yet, but we are getting really close to the answer.  He is getting all the data together for the sales pitch now, so that everything will go smoothly next week.  He is also attacking all the other companies that relate to the producers.  Wade & Robin & Chris are working on the Dominion producers to try to see if they can approximate the high level summary retroactive reallocation volume adjustments that Chris has prepared.  I will forward you Wade's email from Dominion that says that any additional detail is tied up in bankruptcy court.  When they get done, we will be able to approximate what the $ impact is in pushing the producers back to 12/3/02.  Your paralegal & Maria really made alot of progress on finding the contracts.  I think we are up to a 100% success ratio going forward.  They still need to go back and try to find the missing ones.  We sent you a "big gift" of contracts to your D.C. office for Monday delivery.    NY Ed begged me to make sure that the DRI letter gets out on Friday.  I told him that he was going to have to argue 120 new cases in front of the court.  Hee Hee  Our Ed is taking vacation on Friday, June 28th.  We will need to make sure everything gets done so that the letter can be signed on Thursday.  I did not get anything done on the other things we discussed yesterday.  Have a great weekend, Ruth

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: CATS litigation ;;;   I am not sure why, but I would like a copy of the opinion--- probably for the  same reason I slow down in my car to look at an accident.    	Mary Nell Browning 	04/04/2001 01:59 PM 		  		 To: James Derrick/Enron@EnronXGate, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, John  Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Evans/Legal/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley  Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Chivers/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Frevert/Enron@EnronXGate,  Greg Whalley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jackie  Gentle/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Claire Wright/LON/ECT@ECT,  Raj N Patel - Tax/LON/ECT@ECT, Rex Rogers/Enron@EnronXGate 		 cc: Richard Harper/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Turner/LON/ECT@ECT, Peter  Crilly/LON/ECT@ECT 		 Subject: CATS litigation  Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS  litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties  approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final  figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the  principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take  as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part  of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The  opinion seeks to conclude "what rational businessmen could have intended"  rather than applying the provisions of the contract.    For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that  the  "retrospective consequences" of discovering a latent defect after  payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are  unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow  J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and  therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says  that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature  of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.  As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that  the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The  contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it  is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the  Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price  reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This  statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the  opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties  have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.  Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our  submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the  restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon  which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point  at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have  been a given.   Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our  other counsel have assessed the opinion as "appalling" and "pathetic," and  describe the situation as one where Enron has been "stitched up".   Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country  (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for  recourse.  In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or  expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from  each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster  ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in  fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right.   Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if  you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207  783 6582.  Many thanks.

__label__Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: SDEC / Certosa Holdings ;;;   Tough question.  What happens if they don't pay their legal bills?  Won't  they have difficulty closing?  We can pay their consulting fee up front.  Maybe we can pay it into an escrow account.     What is our concern?  They don't have to use lawyers if they don't want to,  and Shutts doesn't have to work for them if they are uncomfortable.   Obviously, Shutts has the ability to quote an upfront retainer.  I'm sure  they've thought of that all ready.  I guess I'm not clear on our level of involvement with their lawyers.  I believe my availability is good for Wednesday.  Kay

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Talking Points re "reregulation" in California ;;;   As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some  talking points for your use.  Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.  In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new  capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by  proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak  demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level,  has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not  deregulation.  When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices,  Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego  customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current  summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of  Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded  where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers  because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside  of the PX (i.e. the spot market).  In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional  generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.   Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time  for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market  responds.  The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition  not reregulation.  Policy makers should:  Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it  is needed.  Expedite interconnection of new generation.  Expedite siting of new facilities.  Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side  solutions.   Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff  Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Azurix News ;;;   USA: Enron offers to take Azurix private at $7/share.  10/27/2000 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2000.  HOUSTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Wholesale energy marketer Enron Corp. said on  Friday it had made a proposal to the board of its troubled water services  affiliate Azurix Corp. to provide up to $275 million in financing to take  Azurix private at a buyout price of $7 per share.  "The proposed cash buyout allows Azurix public shareholders to receive a  significant premium to the market price of Azurix. Enron believes the value  offered also would be greater than any sale to a third party," Enron said in  a statement. The specific structure of the proposal has yet to be determined, it added.  Enron said it expected the proposal to have a neutral impact on its own  earnings and credit outlook.  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Enron Makes Proposal To Azurix Board To Finance $7/Share Buyout  10/27/2000 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) made a proposal to provide funding to  take Azurix Corp. (AZX) private at a buy-out price of $7 a share.  In a press release Friday, Enron proposed to finance up to $275 million for  the sole purpose of the buyout. The specific structure of the proposal hasn't  been determined yet. Enron owns about two-thirds of the company.  Azurix shares were halted at $3.94, up 38 cents or 10.5%, on New York Stock  Exchange composite volume of 111,500 shares. Average daily volume is 239,044  shares.  In a separate press release Friday, Azurix confirmed it received a proposal  from Enron to provide funding to take Azurix private at a buyout price of $7  a share.   Enron, an electricity, natural gas and communications company, said the  proposal would likely have a neutral impact on its own positive earnings and  credit outlook.  Enron said the proposed cash buyout allows Azurix shareholders to receive a  "significant" premium to the market price of Azurix.  Enron's shares were recently trading at $77.94, up 44 cents, or 0.6%, on New  York Stock Exchange volume of 948,100 shares. Average daily volume is 2.4  million shares.  Enron said it believes the value offered would be greater than any sale to a  third party.   Enron said the proposed buyout provides other benefits to Azurix, including a  "significant" near-term reduction in Azurix's general and administrative  expenses, greater certainty to Azurix's customers and employees and increased  flexibility for restructuring Azurix's assets and business.  At June 30, Azurix had general and administartive expenses of $71.3 million.  Enron reported $60 billion in revenue for the first nine months of this year.  As reported in July, Azurix announced it was exploring strategic  alternatives. German utility E.On AG (EON) was considering a bid for all or  part of Azurix, according to a British newspaper.  Azuirx, which manages water and wastewater assets, reported fiscal 1999  revenue of $618 million. The company is currently the target of several  shareholder lawsuits and a fight over water rights in California.  -Stephen Lee; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re(2): SCE AL-1410 re standby rates and interconnection ;;;   We had been in discussions with SCE a few months back to remove the QF requirement in their Rule 21.  At the time they said they "could" not because the construct of their standby rate did not provide adequately provide recovery for standby service (particularly for non-demand related tariff schedules).  The rejection was were we left the subject with SCE. Their move to submit an advice letter on the subject comes as a surprise to me given their prior response.  We will not be protesting with the presumption that the standby tariff would not prejudice future work on standby tariff rate design.  Generally speaking, the QF requirement is ridiculous and should be removed immediately.  For this reason, we are supportive of it happening now through this advice filing.  I do not want to see the prohibition against non-QF facilities for up to another 9 months (rough estimate based on time-frame articulated in the DG order).    Jeff_Dasovich@enron.com writes:

Did you know?      In Norse mythology, the souls of warriors who died nobly in battle were brought to a magnificent palace, where they spent their days fighting for diversion, immune from lasting injury, and their evenings lustily feasting on freshly killed boar and quaffing freely-flowing mead. In Old Norse, the word for this warrior heaven is "Valholl" (literally, "hall of the slain"); in German, it is "Walhalla." English speakers picked up the name as "Valhalla" in the 18th century. Nowadays, we can use the word figuratively, and induction or admission into a modern-day Valhalla doesn't require passing from this life. It can be a place of honor (a hall of fame, for example) or a place of bliss (as in "an ice cream lover's Valhalla").

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Budget Language on Cal PX ;;;   It looks as though the budget language which would unwind the Commission's  recent decision to allow competition with the Cal PX will be passed.   Therefore, in the near term, the Cal PX is the only trading vehicle for the  utilities.  Our lobbyists found NO support in the legislature to buck the language.   Principally because the president of the Commission, Loretta Lynch, was the  one seeking a legislative fix to unwind a decision that her agency issued.   She had greased the skids with both the Republicans and the Democrats to  support the language.    So, as a result, the only thing that the Commission can do at this point is  study the affects of introducing competition with the Cal PX and issue a  report to the legislature by June 1, 2001.  Prior to that date, the  Commission cannot implement any decision on this issue.  Effectively, by the  time any change would occur, we could be at/or near the end of the transition  period, when the mandatory buy/sell requirement would terminate.  We can encourage the Commission to study this issue and use the time as an  opportunity to educate the Commission(ers) about Enron OnLine.  If there were  perceptions that we would not qualify as an exchange, this would be a good  time to dispel that bias.  Government Affairs would be happy to work with you  in organizing such an event.

Remove Lee Munden as the Credit Officer. (There is no credit on an internal  company trade, but we shouldn't have a London credit officer sign-off  showing.) Change the Master type to "ISDA Master" Clarify the Fallback Reference Pricing. Clarify what's going on in the trade. (are we paying in GBP's, are the Strike  Prices in GBP's; etc.)

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: What are you talking about $1600? ;;;     I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry if you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment, but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not, I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as possible.  Thanks.  PL

Thanks.  Ray   BPA short-term policy to encourage the use of small electric generation.  The Bonneville Power Administration hopes to establish a short-term policy to encourage the use of small electric generation to help the Northwest meet its needs during the current energy shortage. Before implementing the policy in June, BPA wants to hear from the public on the details of the plan. The policy will encourage the immediate addition of electricity generation to help the region until planned long-term generation can be built. While BPA will not fund the construction of the generators nor buy the output, the policy complements the load reduction strategy BPA has with its customers. Customers who reduce their load on BPA by 10 percent would be allowed to use temporary small generators to supply a small portion of their needs. BPA has asked its customers to reduce their demands on BPA so BPA can avoid expensive large power purchases in the wholesale market. Such purchases could lead to a triple-digit wholesale rate increase this October. The use of the small generators, along with other actions such as energy conservation, can help decrease reliance on BPA and thus help keep rates down. The generation plants would have to meet all applicable local, state and national regulations. The temporary policy would apply from June 1, 2001, through Sept. 30, 2002.

Harvey Morris of the CPUC to negotiate an extension of time for responding to the five subpoenas issued to Enron affiliates and Portland General.   We negotiated both an extension for initial responses (two weeks) plus an opportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope of the request for production of documents.   This will include a further extension for other documents that are to be produced, as well as a reservation of rights to object to the production of other documents.  We are working in close contact with Richard Sanders and the EPMI legal team in Portland on further refining both responses and potential objections.  However, in light of recent communications between the Governor's office and senior Enron officials, and the prospect of additional such communications, Both Gary and I wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation with the CPUC.   At the beginning of the meeting, as we were indicating the overall burden of the request, the CPUC attorney indicated the extreme pressure the Commission was under to "get to the bottom" of what was happening in the California power markets.  He also recited that "many parties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to the Governor".  He then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providing responses and raised objections to the requests for production instead of cooperating would "be placed on a list of non-cooperative parties" which would be made available to the Governor and legislators and that such parties would have to bear the consequences of such actions.  This rather explicit threat is, in my experience, unprecedented at the CPUC. I also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would never invoke political reprisals on his own, and was obviously instructed to do so by CPUC Pres. Lynch or her senior staff.  Both Gary Fergus and I responded that such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simply trying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discovery requests, but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat.  This comment speaks volumes about the pressure which the CPUC President feels to achieve a politically acceptable result in this matter.  Those senior Enron officials in communication with the Governor should be made aware of this incident.  Mike Day

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: GA Accomplishments - Valuation Methodology - and other issues ;;;   Colleagues: I hope that a short note on methodology on accomplishments' valuation will be  of help to all of us at this stage.  Up to this moment, the current criteria  is still the same established by Jim, John, and Gia Team in the last two  years.  Its purpose was, and still, is to ensure that Public Affairs  continues to generate more value than actual expense.    The process,  hopefully, should drive GA staff to view themselves as "originators" creating  bottom-line value through (as an example): revenue enhancement (new opportunity, market expansion) cost reduction (e.g., fee delay, rate decrease).  The value calculation process focused on the following rules (called SCORE): Simplicity Consistency Objectivity Reasonableness Equity  Perhaps it is helpful  to list some of the methodologies submitted so far.   With no specific preference, they are:   A percentage of Enron's business on a specific hub, or transmission  connection (the percentage is subjectively determined)  Impact of a specific deal on Enron's stock price (in total or part, again,  subjectively determined)  The result of what-if analysis to estimate the would be cost had the  legislation passed (or did not pass), or a settlement reached (or not reached) The amount of financing needs that was secured for a deal NPV of a project.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: More CUTS procedures ;;;   For all cuts the following procedures apply...  1.) Notes as usual  2.) In the Enpower Path Confirmation, we need to make cuts as Path Confirms. Enter comments in the confirmed section. We will be zeroing Enpower deals out on Monday (hint: NOTES are VERY important--All CUTS must be notated and the notes must be put in the accordion folders).  3.) Try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us. Just "bow out" gracefully if you have no other options with the words "L - D's."  4.) If we are cut by a generator/utility going into California, we must call the HA desk at California and tell them the increment that we will be underscheduling our load by. For example, EPE will be cutting all schedules going into California on light load (100 mws). If we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 100 mws. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. We have posted an LC with Cali for this reason.  Also, EPE will be long RT 100 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us. 25 mws should be sold to TEP to cover a forward schedule. Stacy has set this up at PV. Please do this as a direct bill with EPE. As of Jan 01, 2002 we will no longer be marketing for EPE. Also, PV#3 will be coming off this weekend, and FC#4 will be down from HE 22 on Saturday through HE 06 on Sunday.  This will probably not be a fun weekend.  I appreciate your help.   Bill

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: TW ;;;     We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.    The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge   a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I   agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What   exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation   process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can   someone help me with this?    Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would   say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.    However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our   language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and   fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and   fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.    However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the   language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.

In case you didn't hear, our first offer on our house fell  through.  Fortunately, we already have another offer and the new closing  date is November 26.  All indications are that this one will go through so  here's the timeline...  We're leaving Houston on December 3.  We'll be  in our new house in Florida sometime between Dec 7 - 15th.  That gives us  just enough time to get settled in before the new semester starts on  January 7.   We've set up a hotmail account so we don't miss any  emails until our new Florida DSL account is ready to go.  You can start  using it immediately: scubadoobydoo_FL@hotmail.com     (Our panacea account will be valid through the end of  November.)  You can always use our website to get the active email  address.  Go to www.scubadoobydoo.com  and click on  "Contact Us".   We'll give everybody our change of address info as  soon as both home sales are officially done.     Have a great Thanksgiving! Kristi and Greg  Foster

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Settlement Call and Analysis of Termination Notice Issue ;;;   This is a long email, you may want to print out to read.  Settlement Conference Call Issues:  We are set for the 8:30 conference call tomorrow morning.  I'll come to your offices.   Have Leslie and Tom had any discussions about the calculation of  the proof of claim?  I assume not given that they want EPMI to sign the confidentiality agreement that I faxed to you yesterday.  The confidentiality agreement essentially says that we'll treat any communications and documents shared in the settlement discussions as confidential.  The only problem I have with the scope is that for the pure factual exchange about how they are calculating our proof of claim (the unpaid electricity sold in May, June and July), that is not confidential or proprietary information and we shouldn't  have to go take discovery to prove it up if we aren't able to reach a settlement. However, that discovery should not be burdensome, and I doubt that the Trustee will agree to go forward with the settlement conference unless we sign the agreement.       Action Required:       1.   I would appreciate it if you would look at the agreement and let me know whether you're willing to sign it.  If so, please execute it and fax it  to me so that I can get it to the Trustee before the call tomorrow so that we  don't waste any time.       2.   If you don't want to enter into it, then please let me know so that  I can let them know and determine whether there is anything we can discuss with the trust tomorrow.       3.   Could you please let me know what phone number that I should give  the Trustee and counsel for them to call us tomorrow at 8:30 am.  If you'd prefer that we place the call, let me know and I'll get the phone number -- (but I suggest that the cost of the call be on their ticket.)  Termination Notice Issues:       We have taken a look at the law in Texas in connection with their anticipated allegation that we did not provide notice consistent with the  terms of the Master Agreement, they did not receive the June 25 letter, and, consequently, we did not properly terminate the transactions under the Master Agreement and are not entitled to use the termination payment provisions of  the Master Agreement.       The bottom line is that if we can prove actual receipt, then sending it  to the wrong address will not negate the effectiveness of the notice.  Texas Utilities Electric Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 786 S.W.2d 792 (Tex.  App. -- Dallas 1990).  The standard used in most cases is "substantial compliance" rather than "strict compliance."  "An address that is correct in all respects, except that it is not the address in the notice section of the contract can fully perform the function of the specified address, absent the special circumstance that a particular separate address for distinct purpose is  brought to the attention of the contracting party."  Ray v. Metropolitan Life Ins.  Co., 858 F. Supp. 626, 628 (S.D. Tex. 1994).  I assume that there was no discussion about the address given in the Master Agreement and no discussion about the importance of using that address for the June 25 non-payment notice.       Section 8.3 of the Master Agreement states that "Notice by facsimile . .  . shall be deemed to have been received by the close of the Business Day on  which it was transmitted . . . ."  Thus, by the terms of the Master Agreement  itself, EPMI's transmission confirmation should be sufficient to prove that it was transmitted and received.       If PCA disputes receipt, we have the burden to prove receipt.  Although a notice provision that allows delivery by mail of fax shifts the risk of non-delivery of the notice from the sender to the intended receiver, if the sending party fails to use the address specified in the contract, the risk of non-delivery shifts back to the sender.  See, e.g., University Emergency Medicine Foundation v. Rapier Investments, Ltd., 197 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 1999).       In terms of what evidence we can present to prove that the fax was sent  and actually received, obviously the fax and confirmation sheet are the most important pieces of evidence we have.  In addition, we would want to have testimony from the author (James Fallon and/or Jeff Hodge) and the person who actually faxed it (Jeff's secretary (?) who made the hand written notation on the fax cover sheet).  In Ray, Judge Hughes stated:  "[t]he evidence showed  that it [the letter] was prepared and processed as were all of the other letters  sent to Energy Resources.  The likelihood that the letter was not received is  remote, especially since all the other correspondence was received."  858 F. Supp. at 628.   Proof that all the other confirmation notices were received at the CT address and acted upon by PCA will help us carry the burden of proof on actual receipt.       Our waiver or modification argument based upon course of dealing is not  as strong as I had hoped.  The Master Agreement provides in section 8.6 that  "[n]o . . . modification to this Master Agreement shall be enforceable unless  reduced to writing and executed by the Parties."  Courts have upheld these non-modification provisions.  See, e.g., Brookside Farms v. Mama Rizzo's Inc., 873 F. Supp. 1029 (S.D. Tex 1995).  In Brookside, the court articulated the black letter law  just described, but then found that the non-waiver clause  did not protect the party asserting it because of certain equitable factors.  If  the PCA New York office was closed or defunct at the time the June 25th letter was sent , we could rely on that to try to escape the non-waiver clause ruling in Brookside.  Motion to Compel Arbitration:  A quick and interesting update:  As you recall, the Trustee has asked for an extension of the briefing schedule to allow them to determine whether we will settle the case.  Richard was agreeable to a "short" extension.  When I communicated this back, Jane Parver indicated that the Trustee would want discovery of the intent of the parties in connection with the arbitration clause.  From previous conversations with Elizabeth, my sense is that the "intent" evidence is nonexistent because it was not "negotiated," or the evidence will not necessarily help us because at the time the Master Agreement was entered into, EPMI wanted a more limited arbitration clause.  If I understand correctly, similar agreements now have broader language to require arbitration or any and all disputes.  Please let me know if I'm incorrect in  my assumption.  I assume that we will go along with the "short" extension of two weeks, but if Parver follows through on her statement, she's going to want a deposition of someone knowledgeable of the intent of the arbitration clause.  I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.  Thanks.    **********NOTE********** The information contained in this email message is intended only for use of the individual or entity named above.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales ;;;   Carole Norulak 4134 Greensburg Pike Pittsburgh, PA 15221 carole@aemhmr.org  To Mr. Ken Lay,  I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.  Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.  The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.  Sincerely,  Carole Norulak

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below so we  can continue to successfully manage our events.  -  All ECT-NA meetings and events with costs in excess of $5K must be  reviewed by the ECT Public Relations department and approved by the ECT-NA  Office of the President before making any commitments to vendors or customers.  -  Depending on your needs, the PR department will either work with you to  plan and produce your event in its entirety or simply review and evaluate an  event you have planned.  In either case, the PR department will be  responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and for  ECT.    -  A completed expenditure request form (blank attached) and supporting  documentation is required for each event.  You should submit completed  expenditure request forms and documentation to the ECT PR Dept. at EB3642 or  work with PR to complete the form.  -  After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ECT Office of  the President for final approval.    Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions regarding this  process or would like assistance in planning an event, please contact Mike  Rosen in the ECT Public Relations Dept. at (713) 853-9624.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: San Diego Pricing Matrix Update ;;;   FYI, after some analysis and internal communication, we've decided to  increase the standard term options.  The SDG&E Daily Price Sheet will now exhibit Enron offers for 3,4 and 5 year terms, with all terms ending in May  of the final contract year.  The value of the 2 year (18 months) term is a  hard sell and comprises only a small portion of concluded deals.  The new  terms should address this issue and provide a backdrop of more aggressive  prices.  Keep in mind that if you have customers requesting the 2 year price,  it's not a problem.  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not  hesitate to call.     Regards, Marcus x31429

I print this page for him everyday and fax it to him if traveling.   Unfortunately, there appears to be something in the margins that prevents the  "To Date" column from printing.

If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Sharpen Your Netiquette ;;;   Netiquette.  What's that?    Well, in case you didn't know, Netiquette is the proper use of e-mail.   Because we all spend a large portion of our day communicating with customers,  vendors and co-workers via e-mail, here are some tips to help you polish your  e-mail skills and send you on your way to Netiquette success.   Short & Sweet Keep your messages concise and to the point.  Cluless In . . . The subject line can be a couple of words or a short phrase that gives the  reader a hint to the contents of your message.  ARE YOU ANGRY? The use of UPPERCASE text is the equivalent of yelling in the world of  e-mail.  Lower the case and, thus, your e-mail voice.  Are You Still Angry!!!?? Watch out for excessive punctuation like exclamation points.  If something is  important, put it in words, not exclamation points.  We Can Become Too Attached Think of your reader and, whenever possible, put your message in the body of  the e-mail rather than in an attachment.  Does Everyone Need To Know? Be careful when you send replies to "all recipients" of an e-mail.  Ask  yourself if everyone really needs to see your response.  If not, you'll be  using up disk space, cluttering inboxes and slowing the mail servers  unnecessarily.

NEW DELHI -- Enron Corp.'s troubled Indian power project turned up the heat  in its battle with its only customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity  Board, by taking a formal step toward ending its contract in six months.  Dabhol Power Corp. also outlined the key points it says should underpin  future negotiations in the dispute over unpaid bills.  The fight between Dabhol and Maharashtra is closely watched because the $3  billion power plant near Bombay is India's largest foreign investment.  Dabhol, of which Enron owns 65%, says it's owed $48 million in unpaid bills  by the state electricity board for December and January. However, the  cash-strapped electricity board counters that Dabhol owes it four billion  rupees ($85 million) in fines for a service lapse around the same time, which  Dabhol disputes. On Saturday, Dabhol issued a preliminary termination notice, the first of  several prescribed steps toward ending the contract. It triggers a six-month  cooling-off period.  "After months of working with Maharashtra State Electricity Board, government  of Maharashtra and government of India to find solutions, it is apparent that  MSEB and [Maharashtra] are unwilling to honor their...commitments," Dabhol  said. The statement also blasted India's central government, saying it  recently failed to send a representative to the first round of talks over the  dispute. Dabhol holds a guarantee from the central government to cover  payment defaults.  Vinay Bansal, chairman of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, said he  received Dabhol's notice and will respond, although "we will take some time;  we have the six-month suspension to work with," he said. In the meantime, he  expects negotiations to continue. The state government has set up a panel,  the Godbole Committee, to study the contract between Dabhol and the  electricity board. Dabhol's critics say its rates are unreasonably high.  Dabhol has said its rates aren't out of line.  Dabhol's weekend statement also outlined its terms for resolving the problem,  saying a solution can occur only if the parties contractually bound to  purchase Dabhol's power -- the electricity board, with guarantees from the  state and national governments -- "are willing to either purchase themselves  or find other creditworthy entities" willing to buy electricity from Dabhol's  2,184-megawatt plant. Those requirements "should form the basis for any  future discussions," Dabhol said, "and not the Godbole Committee report."  Mr. Bansal, electricity-board chairman, responded yesterday that the "Godbole  Committee is the forum available for negotiations." He added that "all  discussions should be without prejudice and precondition, and all solutions  will have to be explored."   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Economy Saudis Signal Bigger Is Better In Gas Project By Thaddeus Herrick Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  05/21/2001 The Wall Street Journal A2 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  In tapping some of the world's largest oil companies to help build a  multibillion-dollar natural-gas infrastructure, Saudi Arabia is signaling  that bigger really is better in competing on the world stage.  The oil industry has been notable for its huge mergers in recent years as  Exxon Corp. joined with Mobil Corp., British Petroleum PLC gobbled up two big  American companies, and TotalFinaElf SA of Paris was formed from three  European companies. In consolidating, the companies said that they needed  heft and deep pockets to bid for projects like Saudi Arabia's and match  effectively with national oil companies. Friday, Saudi Arabia said it picked just eight companies to participate in  three projects that are expected to total $25 billion over several years, and  most of the companies selected have grown by mergers or acquisitions in the  past two years.  "This is really a game for the big boys," says Roger Diwan, an analyst with  the Petroleum Finance Co., a consulting firm in Washington, D.C. Mr. Diwan  says the largest companies are willing to take bigger risks, have more  capital and can take a longer view.  Exxon Mobil Corp. of Irving, Texas, and the Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell  Group each will participate in two of the three projects. Other participants  include London-based BP PLC, TotalFinaElf and Enron Corp. of Houston, the  only nonoil company chosen. Chevron Corp. of San Francisco, Rome-based ENI  SpA and USX-Marathon Group of Pittsburgh made the short list, but weren't  selected. "Not everyone wanted this badly," Mr. Diwan says. "But no one  wanted to be left out."  The selection comes more than two years after Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah  invited major oil companies to return to the kingdom. For Saudi Arabia, the  gas projects promise to bring in foreign investment that will help create  jobs for the country's booming work force.  Oil companies, however, are hopeful that the foot in the door will someday  lead to a piece of Saudi's oil business as well. Saudi Arabia sits atop more  than a quarter of the world's oil reserves. While oil has been off limits  since the mid-1970s, when the Saudis nationalized the industry, the  international companies are eager to be in position should oil open up again.  "Ultimately, it's oil that everyone is eyeing," said Fadel Gheit, an analyst  with Fahnestock & Co.  While Exxon Mobil was tapped to lead a project along the Red Sea coast,  leaders for the Ghawar and Shaybah projects aren't expected to be chosen  until June. After that, negotiations on terms for the three ventures will get  under way; it may be months before final agreements are signed.  State oil company Saudi Aramco will hold equity in the projects and oversee  them. Though the projects may include some natural-gas exploration, the main  thrust of the ventures is to build natural-gas infrastructure, such as  petrochemical, desalinization and power plants.  Occidental Petroleum Corp., Los Angeles, will join Enron and leader Exxon  Mobil on the Red Sea project. Both Exxon Mobil and Shell were chosen for the  marquee $15 billion Ghawar project, along with BP and Phillips Petroleum Co.  of Bartlesville, Okla. The Shaybah project in the kingdom's Empty Quarter  will include Shell, TotalFinaElf SA and Conoco Inc. of Houston.  Chevron, which has agreed to acquire Texaco Inc., said the Saudi gas  initiative didn't meet the company's business objectives. Chevron bid on the  Ghawar project and hoped to make exploration and production as well as  petrochemical investments, said spokesman Fred Gorrell. But apparently such  investment opportunities weren't offered. Chevron is still thought to be  well-positioned in Saudi Arabia because of Texaco's exploration and  production activity in the so-called neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and  Kuwait.  Industry analysts say Saudi Arabia is also hoping to give Washington more  incentive to protect the kingdom from its Middle East adversaries, while at  the same time allowing the country to keep political distance from the U.S.   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

He  mentions no word of Enron, another "gouger." Why? Because the state public  employees' retirement system is heavily invested in Enron, and, in fact,  CalPERS has a billion-dollar business deal with Enron aside from stock. The  state and Enron are business partners. CalPERS is also invested in many other  energy companies. If one studies the energy sector of the financial world,  CalPERS is in the midst of everything. And CalPERS, because of its large  stock holdings, has the power of influence over corporate boards.  So Davis, who has spent the past two years raising campaign funds, is really  just laying down a diversion. The state is an energy gouger and profits from  it.

Enron pulls out of multi-billion-dollar Gulf gas network  05/21/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd  ABU DHABI (AFX) - Enron Corp pulled out of a project to deliver Qatari gas to  the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by selling its 24.5 pct stake in the Dolphin  Energy Project to its partner, the state-run UAE Offsets Group (UOG).  No price was disclosed. UOG will own 75.5 pct of DEL, which was set up in July 2000 to implement the  gas project, while TotalFinaElf continues to hold the remaining 24.5 pct.  "The project has evolved into a strong upstream and gas transportation and  delivery project. Enron is not an upstream company," the managing director of  Enron Middle East explained to reporters.  DEL's chairman Ahmad Ali al-Sayegh said new partners would be brought into  the venture to transport 2 bln cubic feet per day (20 mln cubic metres) of  Qatari natural gas by undersea pipeline to the UAE and on to Oman.  Patrick Rambaud, a TotalFinaElf vice president, said his company wanted to  increase its own equity in DEL. "This project fits perfectly with our  strategy for long-term presence in these countries," he said.  The first phase of the gas project has a price tag of between 3.5-4 bln usd.  str/kl/cmr  For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

ABU DHABI, May 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Enron Corp has bowed out of a $3.5 billion  project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates and sold its stake in  Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL), the project chairman and U.S. firm announced on  Monday.  Enron sold its stake to the UAE Offsets Group (UOG) for an undisclosed amount. Richard Bergsieker, the U.S. firm's Middle East managing director, told a  news conference in Abu Dhabi that Enron did not believe it could add much to  the project in its current stage.  "As the project had evolved into a strong upstream gas supply project and gas  transport and delivery, we don't believe there is a lot of value that Enron  can add," he explained.  "The project requires longterm equity investment in upstream and Enron is  frankly not an upstream company."  DEL Chairman Ahmed Ali al-Sayegh had earlier said that Enron had agreed to  transfer its 24.5 percent stake in Dolphin to UOG for an undisclosed amount,  raising the UAE firm's stake to 75.5 percent. TotalFinaElf holds the  remaining stake.  Patrick Rambaud, TotalFinaElf's senior vice president for the Middle East,  said his firm has formally asked UOG to increase its own stake in the  project. Sayegh, however, said UOG was seeking a different partner.  "We are studying the TotalFinaElf request... (but) there will be another  partner in the project," he said. "Starting tomorrow, we will begin  negotiations with the international firms who have shown interest in  acquiring a state. They are more than eight companies."  He refused to name the firms but said "everybody who is working in the Gulf  is interested. We are not in a hurry to choose a partner."  PRODUCTION SHARING DEAL ON SCHEDULE  Qatar and DEL in March signed a "commercial term sheet agreement" which  outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited $3.5  billion project.  The two sides aim to sign a production sharing agreement by the end of the  third quarter 2001. Sayegh said they would stick to that deadline. "The  latest date is mid-September," he added.  Qatar, which sits on the world's third largest gas reserves, is seeking to  boost its natural gas exports to the Gulf region after investing billions of  dollars to tap its vast gas riches.  The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North  Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet per day (cfd) of gas. UOG is  to invest $2 billion in developing the tract, drilling and setting up  production facilities.  The remaining $1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up  receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Ali and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi.  First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or  early 2005. About one billion to 1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would be used  by utilities in Abu Dhabi and the remainder supplied to Dubai.  DEL has started inviting local, regional and international companies to  prequalify for five contracts between May 19-23 following the establishment  of a technical project team to oversee the implementation of the first  cross-border gas pipeline project in the Middle East.  Engineering and construction management firms will have two weeks to submit  their prequalification statement for each contract after the date of the  official announcement.

INDIA: India's Enron lenders to lobby for government help. By Anirban Nag and Sriram Ramakrishnan  05/21/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  BOMBAY, May 21 (Reuters) - Indian lenders want the federal government to  intervene after a threat by U.S. energy giant Enron Corp, the country's  largest foreign investor, to walk out of a giant power project put their  loans in jeopardy.  "We want the government to step in and resolve the matter with lenders'  interests in mind. We are continuously monitoring the situation," a senior  official at one of the lenders told Reuters late on Sunday. The official did  not want to be named. Local lenders including the Industrial Development Bank of India, ICICI Ltd  and the country's largest commercial bank, State Bank of India, stand to lose  if Enron pulls out.  They have lent $1.4 billion out of the project's total cost of $2.9 billion.  The rest of the project is being funded through equity and by loans from  foreign banks led by ABN AMRO  Shares of the local lenders fell in early trade on Monday with IDBI sliding  9.39 percent to 24.60 rupees, SBI dipping 1.1 percent to 233.60, while ICICI  was down six percent to 84.90. The 30-share Bombay index was up 0.17 percent  at 3,661.19 points.  The project is now 90 percent complete, but faces an uncertain future after  Enron's Dabhol Power Company (DPC) on Saturday issued a preliminary notice to  terminate power sales from the plant.  DPC cited payment defaults by the buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity  Board (MSEB) and non-cooperation from the federal and state government as the  reason behind the move. The notice leaves the door open for negotiations for  six months.  The latest move is likely to further tarnish India's poor image as a place to  set up power projects.  The federal government has so far not reacted to the termination notice,  although analysts say the country needs to tap more foreign investment in the  power sector.  OTHER CUSTOMERS  "This is a complex problem and cannot be solved instantly. The basic issue is  the cost of power and there needs to be an agreement on a reasonable tariff,"  the official said.  MSEB has said the power produced by DPC is expensive and has refused to buy  the output from the second phase. The contract between the two signed in the  mid-1990s had called for MSEB to buy the entire capacity of 2,184 MW. The  first phase of 740 MW began operations in May 1999.  Enron has said it is open to negotiations and that the cost of power would  fall once the second phase of 1,444 MW starts operations.  The lenders would like the government to clear MSEB's defaults of $48 million  and also find a buyer for electricity from the second phase.  But the banker said roping in other customers to buy the second phase's  output could be difficult to achieve.  "If the first phase is generating excess power, who will buy the power from  the second phase?" he asked.  TO BLOCK FURTHER LOANS  The official said Indian lenders had decided to block further loans to the  second phase till an agreement was reached. The SBI, for instance, had  sanctioned about 20 billion rupees ($425.9 million), but has disbursed only  14 billion rupees so far.  Both ICICI and IDBI officials declined to comment, but sources said the  domestic lenders were acting together.  Indian lenders said they were hopeful the matter could be resolved given  there was a window of six months for negotiation.  "There is no reason to panic. We are hopeful that talks will resolve the  issue," said the official.  Indian media speculated at the weekend that the balance sheet of the lenders  would be under pressure if the dispute was not resolved quickly. ($1 = 46.96  Indian rupees).

Dabhol project suffers $400-m cost overruns Anto T Joseph  05/21/2001 The Economic Times Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)  MUMBAI  AS IF the current dispute with the Maharashtra government was not enough, the  Dabhol project now has to deal with cost overruns. The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company has experienced a cost overruns to  the tune of $400 million, taking the total project cost to $3.3 billion.  DPC, which issued a preliminary termination notice to Maharashtra State  Electricity Board on Saturday (May 19), is in a fix as both domestic and  offshore lenders have refused to increase their exposure in the controversial  power project, the largest-ever foreign direct investment, so far, in India.  After Indian lenders stopped disbursements as a fallout of a long payment  crisis, DPC is believed to have scouted for foreign debt, albeit  unsuccessfully, to maintain the debt-equity status quo at 70:30 ratio.  DPC's issuance of PTN has compounded the problem. According to the power  purchase agreement between the MSEB and Enron, issuing a PTN would mean  fixing a deadline of six months for pulling the final plug on the project.  "As of now, the FIs have held back $250-million debt to the project. Once the  PTN is served, DPC can't expect lenders to make any more disbursements, and  it has almost sealed the fate of the project," said a financial institution  source.  While the 740-mw phase I is operational, the second phase of 1,144 mw was  expected to be fully operational by the year-end. One unit of 740 mw (part of  the second phase) is undergoing trial-runs, and was expected to be  commercially operational in June.  Sources said the huge cost overruns had been a major deterrent in project  completion. Worried by the mounting payment defaults, the EPC (engineering,  procurement and construction) contractor of the project -- Bechtel -- is  believed to have threatened to pull out of the project by mid-June.  The cost overruns stem from devaluation of the rupee vis-a-vis the dollar and  an increase in equipment cost. Indian FIs are now wary of further cost  overruns owing to the delay in project execution.  "Indian FIs, who have contributed 40 per cent of $2.9 billion (earlier  project cost), had refused to take more exposure. DPC was forced to approach  foreign lenders for raising funds to cover the cost overruns. They have also  taken a negative stand," said sources. The ABN-AMRO led offshore consortium  is believed to have refused to contribute any more debt to the project.  The only way out for DPC is for the promoters to increase their equity  contributions. Proportionately, Enron, which holds around 65 per cent in DPC,  will have to shell out a major chunk if this were to happen.  DPC's move to issue PTN has considerably irked Indian institutions. Lenders  were planning to cast a confidential vote on PTN this week. However, armed  with the required mandate from offshore lenders, DPC went ahead and issued  the PTN.

NEWS ROB MORSE The mouth that roared Rob Morse  05/21/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A.2 (Copyright 2001)  Last week I was watching the TV news and saw a frightening sight. An angry  Gray Davis was declaring war on Texas.  "We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price- gouging us,"  the governor said, shaking with something that looked an awful lot like  emotion. "Many of those companies are in Texas." In typical Davis style, the governor is a little late in declaring war on  Texas. If he had been president in 1942, he would have spoken of that day of  infamy in 1941.  It also was a typical Davis half-measure. He didn't declare war on all of  Texas, just the Texans who poll badly in California.  Those would be George W. Bush and his friends and contributors who cut off  our power, robbed us, and then used us as an example of why the nation needs  holes punched in Alaska and hundreds of Homer Simpsons put in charge of  nuclear fuel rods.  Davis isn't the type to boldly declare unlimited war on all of Texas,  certainly not "Austin City Limits," chili and the Texans we love, like Willie  Nelson, Tommy Lee Jones, Charlotte Mailliard Shultz and Willie Brown.  But Davis had a Texas stereotype in mind as he spoke of the hardscrabble  hombres in Houston high-rises who are smart and mean and are holding us up  long-distance. Yep, it's as if Texas is saying to California, "Your money or  your lifestyle."  Davis said he would retaliate each month by naming a Texas corporation "pig  of the month."  Yeah, that'll hurt those guys at Reliant Energy and Enron.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FERC restructures Cal-ISO ;;;   FERC's action here appears to be the appropriate remedy.  You know it's a  good fix if the utilities and Senator Feinstein don't like it!   FERC Restructures California Power Market Responding to a California power market gone haywire and teetering on the  brink of operational and financial disaster, FERC Friday issued a series of  remedial measures, virtually stripping the Cal-PX and Cal-ISO of their  control of the market and calling market stakeholders together to negotiate  bilateral forward contracts.  The Commission's main action, effective with the issuance of the order after  the Friday afternoon meeting, removes the requirement that California  utilities buy and sell exclusively through the California Power Exchange  (Cal-PX) and clears the way for bi-lateral contracts in the forward market.  FERC scheduled a settlement conference for Dec. 19 in Washington of parties  in the state's power market to negotiate those contracts.  "California does [not] have the benefit of a competitive market," Chairman  James Hoecker said, noting he had heard the state's power market called  "crisis by design." The design was "an unworkable state law, the product of  command and control that described in detail" exactly how the market should  function. "It wasn't competition," Hoecker said. "It's time to get serious  about saving the future of competitive markets...Competition did not fail in  principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never  well-conceived or tried. This version of competition was a disaster."  Commissioner William Massey defended the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission's backing away from price caps.  "Rather than cap the spot market  created by the state of California, the order would simply shrink its size  and diminish its influence." This will "give back participants' ability to  find the right price; This ability is what California has taken away from  that market."  Massey said the action would allow bilateral transactions, support forward  contracts, and allow the parties to manage risk.  He urged the California  Public Utilities Commission to "step up to its responsibilities" in  supporting the FERC-directed activities.  Massey said the transfer of wealth in what he described as the "apocalypse"  in California "is absolutely staggering. The two largest utilities are  virtually bankrupt."  He predicted a court, acting on accepted law and  precedent, would eventually rule the utilities are entitled to recover the  costs from customers, spreading the costs out over the entire state.  PG&E Corp. officials lambasted the Commission's actions, saying they left  California's electric customers "exposed to price gouging and future electric  supply reliability uncertainty."  "The California wholesale market is broken. And we are extremely disappointed  by the insufficiency of today's FERC order," PG&E officials said in a  statement. "The remedies outlined in the order do not go nearly far enough to  provide a solution that ensures reliability of the state's electric supply  and equally importantly, provides relief from future price gouging," the  Northern California utility company said. PG&E said it was particularly  disappointed that FERC did not call for retroactive price refunds for  California electric customers, as was requested by Gov. Gray Davis. The  utility also said it was "especially troubled" that FERC shortened the  timeframe for the electric price cap from the end of 2002 to April 2001,  "leaving customers exposed during the high-demand summer season."  Sen Dianne Feinstein, (D-CA), said FERC's action was unacceptable. "Rome is  burning, our utilities are close to bankruptcy, Californians are facing major  blackouts, and the Commission is fiddling."  Hoecker said similar competitive problems in states in the Pacific Northwest  have led to pleas from governors and others for regional price caps. But he  pointed to the fact that FERC is severely limited in what it can do in that  region. For one, it lacks authority over the Bonneville Power Authority and  other federal operations there, which make up a major portion of the market.  Further, there is no Northwest spot market that can be capped in the way caps  operate in California. There also would be problems with the many purchasers  who already had hedged or protected themselves in some way. Hoecker strongly  urged Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to convene a conference to try to  identify regional problems, and offered his help in this.  Commissioners Curt Hebert and Massey said they would issue concurring  opinions. Hoecker said he will submit a concurring opinion next week on items  such as RTOs that are beyond the scope of the order. The Commission's  actions, which went beyond recommendations it had made earlier (see Daily  GPI, Nov. 2), came at an emergency meeting following a week of continuous  power alerts and emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts in the state.  The Commission's reforms call for:  _ No retroactive refunds for California customers;  _ Elimination of the requirement that California's three investor-owned  utilities --- Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric and  Southern California Edison --- sell all of their power into the Cal-PX, and  buy all of their power from the Cal-PX. This took effect Friday;  _ Return 25,000 MW of generation to state regulation;  _ Termination of the Cal-PX wholesale rate schedule effective the close of  the trading day on April 30, 2001;  _ Create a benchmark price for wholesale bilateral contracts to assess prices  of five-year energy supply contracts;  _ Create penalties for underscheduling power loads;  _ A requirement that market participants schedule 95% of their load prior to  real time. Violators will incur penalties for scheduling deviations exceeding  the greater of 10 MW or 5% of their hourly load;  _ Begin market monitoring and price mitigation for the Cal-ISO and PX spot  markets. FERC will hold a technical conference to develop a monitoring an  mitigation program. A proposed plan is to be submitted by March 1 so that the  measure can be in place by May 1;  _ A single-priced auction to be used only for bids at or below $150/MW. Bids  above $150/MW will not set the market clearing price, although they will be  subject to FERC reporting requirements;  _ Replacing the current Cal-ISO stakeholder governing board with a  non-stakeholder board. On Jan. 29, 2001, the Cal-ISO governing board members  will be required to turn over their decision-making power and operating  control to the management of the Cal-ISO. The members will be permitted to  function in an advisory capacity until the new board is selected. FERC to  discuss with California representatives a process for selecting new Cal-ISO  board members; and  _ Modify interconnection procedures.  The ISO and utilities must file  generation interconnection procedures.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Needles/Topock Price Differentials ;;;   I have had a casual chat with some of my accounts regarding their opinion of  the market dynamics affecting the Needles to Topock price differentials.   Each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of Topock gas  supplies, rather than the incremental intra-state transport costs required to  transport to the PG&E citygate, as the primary driving force for the Needles  to Topock  price differential.      Here is a recurring theme I heard from my customers:  The El Paso Merchant  Service (EPMS) 1.2 BCF contract's Block II capacity (500 MMcf/d of Permian to  PG&E/Topock capacity,  $.065 transport rate) has a re-callable aspect.  If  EPMS schedules gas under the transport of Block II capacity to any other  California delivery point other than PG&E/Topock, then other parties may  recall the capacity for their own use to PG&E/Topock.  Currently Duke has  recalled 100 MMcf/d and PG&E Energy Trading has also recalled 100 MMcf/d for  their use to transport Permian gas to PG&E/Topock. (FYI - EPMC may re-recall  this capacity, but they have elected not to).  These additional Topock  supplies coming from Duke and PG&E Energy Trading under Block II capacity may  be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to PG&E at Topock.  This gas  competes head to head with Malin gas prices.  For example, today's Malin  price is $4.62 while PG&E/Topock price is $4.69.    Today's cash price  differential between Needles and Topock is $.60, far larger than the  previously assumed $.28 differential resulting from the intrastate cost  required to bring Topock gas to the citygate.      If anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding these  market dynamics, let's discuss further at our next staff meeting. CS

The new term  opens October 1, so in principle we could go any time after that date.  I am  predicting toward the end of 1Q 2001.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Exmar options ;;;   This is not yet dead.  Apparently, Exmar and the shipyard are working to keep  the options alive at least for a little while longer.  At the same time, I  met with Amin in London yesterday (the organizer of Project Summer Lightning)  who may have money to commit to this.  We will work with Amin and Exmar over the next several days to see if we  could structure something where Amin's investors go long on a ship, and we  have the exclusive right to use it with some money in it for his investors if  we are able to make money with it.  This is a long shot, but we will try  Rick

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Interzonal   Trading ;;;   Attention: The Ercot ISO has been settling our trades scheduled to the North by giving us the West or South Balancing Energy price.      We have officially disputed this allocation, as we believe that we would,  at most,  incur a load deviation imbalance in the North zone (to be settled in the North).   Again,  a purchase in the South scheduled to our load in the North is receiving the South or West prices.  We are awaiting Ercot's explanation.  Until further notice,  do not schedule energy from the South or West to the North.         You may still engage in intrazonal, or same zone,   trades (QSE to QSE ).  What IS permitted is imported from outside Ercot into the North zone.     The DC tie is in the North and we should stay aggressive,  working with the SPP team to secure transmission to and from Ercot.    When in doubt,   wake me up.  Update:  At 6 pm,  our Rep from Ercot agreed that the schedule mentioned above should have load imbalance assessed at the NORTH price.     However,   I still cannot accept his answer as the gospel,  as any written interpretation of their tariff will always overrule our guy.   I will advise when it is safe to re-enter the water,  but for now:   EVERYBODY OUT OF THE POOL!   JMF

This is a position we will deliver on to preserve the in-the money value.   I would make it clear to Wisconsin that we intend on delivering in January and every single month thereafter because it creates positive cash flow for the estate.   We also have broker quotes that show the market is 28 at 29 for Cal 02.   I would accept nothing less  than $1.2 million.   Thanks.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast ;;;   Dear Vincent,  The Washington bureau will bring us more on the EPA decision to recommend changes to the nation's fuel specifications on Thursday. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the proposal to reduce the number of boutique fuels across the country will likely draw mixed reaction.   We'll have the latest on energy legislation from the Senate.  There continues to be mixed signals coming from both parties on the likelihood of a deal that could pave the way for a comprehensive energy bill to reach the floor.     Also in Washington, a long list of energy influentials will speak at the Alliance to Save Energy's Summit on Energy Efficiency.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and S. David Freeman, the Chairman of California's new state power authority are among the scheduled participants.  We'll have coverage of the Summit from the Washington bureau on Thursday.   Houston has long been called the energy capital of the world and downtown Houston has always been considered the energy corridor.  Now the Woodlands, a community located north of Houston, is staking its claim as the next energy corridor of the area.  On Thursday the Woodlands Chamber of Commerce is hosting an energy forum to discuss the area's growth and ways to attract more companies.  We'll bring you details from the Houston bureau tomorrow.   We'll take a rare look Thursday into the largest nuclear power plant in Texas.  South Texas Project Electric Generating Station invited members of the news media to tour secured areas as nuclear plants around the country upgrade security in light of the threats and attacks on America.    Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research Mark Meyer will drop by to discuss how oil stocks are doing this quarter.  Catch Meyer during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast.   The California Public Utilities Commission is meeting on Thursday.  West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the agenda may include the Rate Agreement between the CDWR and the PUC along with the issue of Direct Access.     Kym also reports, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District is boosting its capacity.  This move will add to what is already the largest utility-owned distributed photovoltaic system in the world.  Kym will bring us details on Thursday.   Finally from the West Coast bureau, we'll have comments from California Governor Gray Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio on the federal government's plans to expand Path 15.  Join us for these stories from the West Coast bureau tomorrow.   From ENL Headquarters on Thursday, Williams Energy Partners L.P. Chief Financial Officer Don Wellendorf will join us to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings.  And Edward Jones Senior Energy Analyst Zach Wagner will join us from St. Louis to continue the discussion on earnings.  Wagner will discuss Enron during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: When life hands you lemons... ;;;   ...try not to get the juice in your eyes, it really stings  Well, I'm sure you've already heard through Mom...but I think things may be  kaput with Ted.  I say "think" because he hasn't said anything one way or the  other, it's just a vibe I have.  So I don't think you guys are going to have  a chance to meet him while your in Houston.  Oh well, it was definitely fun  while things were going well so I suppose I should focus on that.  I just  want to know why guys can be such, as dad would say, chicken shits (excuse my  language but the description fits).  But enough about me...So how are things with you guys.  I hope all is well  and that you're taking full advantage of all the 'culture' surrounding you.   We went to the first football game of the season Saturday (against Louisiana  Lafayette).  Texas won 52-10, and you wouldn't know if from the score but the  1st quarter was a little bit scarey (0-10).  Simms started the game but only  played about 2 series before they yanked him and put Applewhite in to put  some points on the board.  Simms did come back in the second half and through  a touch-down pass.  The family's good and we're all excited to see you guys  in the near future.  Write back soon, Susan  ******** Humor is the best medicine.********  So I'm thinking of taking the T-shirt Ted gave me from Beaver Creek and  writing this on the back of it...

Give me a  call on my cell phone to fill me in on what the group decides.    Finally, what information do you have about where generators and other large  customers groups (i.e., CMTA, the Chamber and CLECA) are on the bill?  Best, Jeff    	MDay <MDay@GMSSR.com> 	07/17/2001 12:38 PM 		  		 To: "'Jeff.Dasovich@enron.com'" <Jeff.Dasovich@enron.com>,  James.D.Steffes@enron.com 		 cc: Harry.Kingerski@enron.com, Paul.Kaufman@enron.com,  Susan.J.Mara@enron.com, Leslie.Lawner@enron.com, MDay <MDay@GMSSR.com> 		 Subject: RE: AB 23XX Bad Bill Alert   Jeff; In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups will surface soon.  As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way, and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans for building across the border into California, although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs.  Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT:  ;;;   The leadership situation in Japan is always relatively volatile and this  period is no exception.  Following a further political gall by the PM over  the North Korean hostage situation and ongoing adverse media attention on his  cabinet, it is likely that the PM and his senior cabinet will be replaced  within weeks, if not days.  As a matter of protocol the successors to the Prime Minister and Minister of  State, Nakagawa, will keep the appointments set by the predecessors.  The  focus is more on the position than the individual - so the Minister of State  will open the office in the name of the PM whether it is Nakagawa or someone  else.  Similarly, Mr Lay will have a meeting with the PM whether it is Mori  or his successor.  Fortunately, we have very good relationships with the person most likely to  be the next PM of Japan - Mr Katoh - and the person who will most likely be  the next head of the Governing LDP - Mr Kamei.  Both Mr Katoh and Mr Kamei  have indicated that they will attend the office opening.  As mentioned in my previous note, we had anticipated that the budget  legislation would have been passed well before the office opening.  I also  mentioned that the budget is likely to pass on the 31st or 1st.  One possible  scenario on the timing for the replacement of Mori is immediately after the  budget legislation is passed.  That timing would be problematic for us, as  most senior politicians would be focused on the change of leadership during  that period.  I will keep you informed as the political situation develops.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Bullets 11/3 ;;;   New Mexico Train De-railment - Most of this week was spent helping customers  re-route gas as the train derailment on TW's right-of-way in McKinley County,  New Mexico forced Operations to blow down the mainline in the east of Thoreau  area.  The accident reduced flow to the California border by 250,000 MMBtu/d  or 25%.  Once the 27 rail cars were removed, a determination was made that  line would need to be hydro-tested to ensure no damage had occurred.   Approximately 2000 feet of pipe was excavated, the coating inspected and/or  replaced, and if test results are good, the line should be back in service  sometime during the weekend of November 3.  While the pipe is being recoated,  the line segment will only operate at 80% of maximum pressure.  TW costs and  revenue losses are being tracked to enable us to recoup damages from  Burlington and/or Enron business interruption insurance.  Sempra Trading - The loss of gas supply from TW's east end enabled us to sell  a max rate IT agreement for 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra during this outage.   Duke also moved 40,000 MMBtu/d of alternate volume west at max rates.  Transport Options Tariff - The deadline to file protests on TW's Transport  Options Program was Monday October 30.  Twenty-two parties filed  interventions, of which only three were protests: PG&E, SoCal/Sempra, and  Dynegy.  We expect FERC to schedule a technical conference sometime in the  next 30 days.  Non-binding Open Season - The solicitation was published and sent to  customers this week asking for expressions of interest in capacity turnback  or pipeline expansions across all of TW.  Responses are due November 17th.
__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Marketing Services/Scheduling ;;;   Daren,  Thinking about Robert's little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling  the marketing (Sitara) function back to your side of the fence I think a  strong case could be made in favor of that idea.  It is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets, pathing,  nominating, and confirming the Industrials. This dissipates the knowledge  base and the responsibility factor. It is a "Who's on First" issue.  If the responsibility to ensure pricing, volume, and accomplishment of market  intent is accurately depicted, and in Sitara, is in your shop then the  schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of Unify and  POPS. I'm sure this would help volume management and client services  immensely.  As the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and  more of the marketing function (Sitara) to the scheduling group in the hopes  they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture.  I believe the current situation is too much, too fast, for scheduling to  handle all at once. It has also created a situation where Robert seems to  think not only that he has all the segments mastered, but that he is the only  person that should be involved in the Industrials.  I will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue, but if you  and Pat leave things the way they are please explain to both Robert and Pat  that others may be involved in the Industrial activity and that is quite  alright.  Once again, thanks for listening.  Ken  - att1.htm

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT:  ;;;  Another report-- SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services. 1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected government; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7 million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said, JAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed. 2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as healthcare. 3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition, international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security. 4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now re Ializes that due to pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has serious concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the same time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.) 5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. 6. Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader Ali Tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has been unable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000 security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters. In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed. Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiya's main storage centre for election materials. 7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not been proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC), whose military arm set up a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the GNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to disrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barge) 62, and Fezzan in the South 18.)

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: A.Word.A.Day--cataract ;;;   cataract (KAT-uh-rakt) noun     1. A large or high waterfall.     2. A great downpour; a deluge.     3. Opacity of the lens or capsule of the eye, causing impairment of       vision or blindness.  [Middle English cataracte, from Old French, from Latin cataracta, from Greek katarraktes, kataraktes, probably from katarassein, to dash down : kat-, kata-, cata- + arassein, to strike.]     "The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep    No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;    I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,    The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep."    William Wordsworth, Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of    Early Childhood.  Have you seen the poem about a little girl who, with a lantern in her hands, goes out in a snowstorm to light the path of her mother coming back from town? Later, her parents go out to look for her, following her footprints in the snow when we discover, "And further there were none!" My heart skipped a beat when I came across those five words. I'm talking about Lucy Gray, a poem by William Wordsworth ( http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww158.html ), that I read in my early school days. Later, the emphasis on math and science, and subsequent studies of computer science in college and grad school, blotted out the world of poetry. I forgot the name of the poet and other details of the poem but it has been haunting me ever since. Recently, while researching some words, I came across the poem again and realized it had never really left me. Does a poem ever do?  What is it in poetry that moves us so much? Perhaps it is a reminder that no matter how tough, and worldly-wise we may or try to be, deep inside all of us have the heart of a child. In this week's AWAD, I'll present words from some of my favorite poets. Why don't you email me (anu@wordsmith.org ) about your favorite poets and their poems?                                        -Anu  ............................................................................ The first human who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization. -Sigmund Freud, neurologist, founder of psychoanalysis (1856-1939)  Q: Some time ago you featured a quote/word about x in AWAD.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Status of Various Delta Items ;;;   Kay:  I spoke with Isabel Parker on the following issues:  1.  I requested copies of the note, security agreement and the non-disturbance lien document.  She said they will be using a securities account with a securities intermediary structure (UCC Article 8 concept) rather than a non-disturbance lien.  She said they are working on these documents and will furnish as soon as possible.  2.  I advised that the ENA consent is satisfactory.  3.  I advised of the timing issue on the GE consent, such that the GE acknowledgement of payment needed to be prospective due to logistical issues.  She is considering this.  4.  She requested a quick response on whether the GE letter agreement is consistent with Enron's discussions with GE, as she needs to get this to GE as soon as possible in order that they will be ready to sign it on Friday 4/20.  The GE letter agreement (agreeing to the form of all of the documents) must be signed this Friday 4/20 before the lenders will advance funds, as this letter agreement is a condition precedent to funding.  Please advise on this issue.  I also spoke with Greg Lang and expect comments on the Escrow Agreement within a half hour or so.  I reminded him of the need for a W-9 and an incumbency certificate to open the escrow account.  (Estelle Lawrence has also called looking for the escrow agreement).  Carolyn M.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: GPCM Summary 1999 ;;;   This has been a great year for RBAC and GPCM. During the year we have doubled to 10 the number of GPCM licensees. This means we've also doubled the number of wonderful people we've trained and are supporting. And, I sincerely mean it when I say it has been a real pleasure working with you all. One of the things we stress when we are selling GPCM is that it takes a strong commitment on the part of the licensee, a commitment to find skilled and dedicated people to make optimal use of this sophisticated tool.  And, I'm happy to report that we have that quality in the GPCM teams we work with. Next year we have some big challenges.  We will be converting the system from Office 97 to Office 2000 and will also need to make sure it will run in the Windows 2000 environment. We will be adding new flexibility in defining our transportation zone price curves to enable users, especially pipeline users, to test variations of pricing strategies for their impacts on basis and utilization. We will be adding a capability for modeling future FT contracting. We will upgrade our existing Database Comparison program to allow you to select those items you want to have automatically updated in your own databases. We will continue to work with RDI to improve pipeline and storage infrastructure representations, to provide interfaces between GASdat and GPCM, and to give you regular optional updates for your own databases. We are beginning to plan out a new website dedicated to GPCM licensees (and possibly prospects).  We have acquired gpcm.rbac.com and gpcm.net for this purpose. In making these various changes, we look also to you, our existing licensees, for enhancement and improvement ideas.  We are planning to conduct interviews of our licensees during the next 30 - 60 days to find out what you like, but also what you would like to see improved, as well as some new ideas for GPCM.  I would like to thank the following people for their contributions to GPCM during 1999.  o Liam Leahy for his excellent marketing, sales, and planning support o Charles Carr for his quality work on our website and support with subtle Visual Basic programming issues o Richard Berman for thorough research on design tools and skilled Windows programming o Richard McBride for continuing support and development of his EMNET optimization program o Aaron and James Brooks for design and production of the PowerPoint pipeline maps now available in GPCM o Mike Farina and RDI for their continuing improvement of the GPCM data and GASdat database o GPCM users who have found data bugs and reported them to use so that we could get them corrected o GPCM users who have suggested new features which would make GPCM a better product o GPCM users who have given us sales leads during the year o GPCM users who have used GPCM to help their companies make better plans and decisions, which is, after all, the purpose for which it was designed  We hope all of you have a wonderful holiday season and look forward to an even better year 2000.

I should get a copy of it today and will circulate it once it is  finalized.  I will also prepare a list of the contracts we have reviewed.  I  am still collecting a few agreements (Ganady Batrak's prior service agreement  and Bob Campbells agreement) and will also be collecting copies of our  agreements with Enron Net Works employees for review.    With respect to the NDA's, they have all been drafted and it is my  understanding that they were sent to our counterparties last week.  Oracle  has already signed an NDA and I have a copy if you would like to have it.  I  would suggest that before we have further conversations with Oracle that we  consider asking them to also sign a non-solicitation agreement with us.  The  NDA with Oracle is the only NDA that does not contain a non-solicitation  provision.    In order to facilitate getting the rest of NDA's signed as quickly as  possible, I would suggest that Rex ask each of his contacts for the name and  phone number of the legal counsel reviewing the agreement and I will give  them a call and find out if they have any issues that need to be resolved.   Obviously the i2 contract should be our priority.  FYI- I received a call from the contact at PriceWaterhouseCoopers and we will  send him a NDA directly.  Anne C.

AEC Storage and Hub Services, a business unit of Alberta Energy Company  Ltd.  BAD NAME.  There is an ISDA Master in place between ECC and Alberta  Energy Company Ltd.  I will approve financial trading with this Counterparty  if the Confirms go out under that name. 2.  Ashland Speciality Chemicals Company, a division of Ashland Inc.  We are  currently negotiating a master with this counterparty.  We earlier sent out a  draft under a division name, and the counterparty came back and told us to  change the name to Ashland, Inc.  So, if we trade under the Ashland, Inc.  name, I can approve it for financial trading. 3.  Bayer Inc., Rubber Division-BAD NAME.  I have already approved trading  under Bayer Corporation. 4.  Coast Energy Group, a division of Cornerstone Propane, L.P. - turning  down to trade financial because we have already approved them for financial  trading under Cornerstone Propane, L.P. 5.  Southwestern Energy Services Company-is a division of Southwestern Energy  Company.  We have an ISDA Master in place with Southwestern Energy Company,  which I will approve for financial trading under that name. 6.  Tenaska Marketing Canada, a division of TMV Corp.-already approved  trading under TMV Corp. 7.  Trammochem, a division of Transammonia Inc. - BAD NAME.   I already  approved them on the first list, and their master is in the name of  Transammonia Inc., acting through it Division Trammochem.  FIX NAME!  For Power  1.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Pipeline safety legislation - update ;;;   print ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 10/16/2000 10:17 AM -----  	Jeffrey Keeler 	10/13/2000 12:28 PM 		  		 To: Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron, Phil Lowry/OTS/Enron@ENRON, John  Shafer/OTS/Enron@Enron, Shelley Corman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, David L  Johnson/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Louis Soldano/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Colleen  Raker/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Michael Terraso/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Steven J  Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe  Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Chris  Long/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Clayton Seigle/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc:  		 Subject: Pipeline safety legislation - update  Since the defeat of the Senate pipeline safety legislation earlier this week  in the House, we have been working on strategies related to action that could  occur before the end of the congressional session.  The following  developments indicate that the legislation is still very much in play, but  our primary concerns are making sure efforts going forward remain under  control and preventing the passage of legislation that goes too far.  Developments:  House Republican leadership is not interested in pursuing the legislation any  further, either through regular procedures or as an attachment to  appropriations, "omnibus" or other must-pass measures.   They are somewhat  angry at the industry for not being able to fight off advances made by Reps.  Dingell and Oberstar, who were able to persuade enough Democrats to vote  against the Senate bill so that it fell short of the 2/3 needed for passage  under suspension of the rules.  Senate bill sponsors/supporters are extremely angry at House Democrats for  killing the Senate legislation, and at the White House/DOT for not strongly  promoting the Senate bill (which they previously had supported) and reigning  in House Democrats.   Senator Patty Murray called the White House and  expressed her concern, which prompted a series of meetings between staff for  Senate and House Democrats and the White House to discuss a solution.     In these meetings, House Democrats have proposed adding several provisions  from the Dingell/Oberstar legislation to the Senate bill and moving that  package on an omnibus or appropriations bill.   Sources close to Rep. Dingell  indicate that they really do not want any bill at all, and are merely keeping  up the pressure in an effort to see if they can get the Senate or industry to  accept tougher provisions.  Senate Democrats (including Murray, Bingaman, and Breaux) are not accepting  any possible amendments to the original Senate bill, and are opposed to  changing the Senate bill at all.   However, Senator Murray and Republican  Senator Slade Gorton (who has a tough election) both want to continue to  pursue the Senate bill (unamended) as a rider to an omnibus/appropriations  bill.      The White House is looking to cover itself from a poor performance in the  House, and is considering drafting an executive order that could be issued if  no legislation passes at all.  It is unclear what could or would be contained  in such an order, but the White House is indicating to Senate staff that it  would be more like the Senate bill than the House bill.  We are working with  sources close to the White House to confirm their strategy.  Strategy going forward:  Upon hearing that some industry associations were on Capitol Hill discussing  "what industry could live with" in terms of provisions added to the Senate  bill, I insisted (along with El Paso and others) that we not take such an  approach, but rather remain consistent in our approach -- we support the  Senate bill and only the Senate bill.   It was approved unanimously in the  Senate and by 60% of the House, and if anything moves forward on an  omnibus/appropriations bill, it should be the Senate bill.  Consistent with  what our Senate friends are doing, we should not even recognize the  Dingell/Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal, nor start accepting  pieces of it as a compromise.  We will be shoring up support for our position of "if anything moves forward,  it should be the Senate bill only" with Senate supporters and leadership in  the House and Senate.  We will also be working to thank the 51 Democrats who  supported us in the House, and make sure they have any cover they need in  case their vote becomes an issue.   In support of Senator Gorton's election  troubles, we will be working to try to get media placement of op-eds that  support the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder  the blame for the bill's defeat.  In particular, we are hopeful that Senator  McCain (who has been passionate about this issue) will write op-eds that can  be placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the  Senate bill.  Congress' state of confusion over omnibus/appropriations bills and last  minute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and  subject to change rapidly, so we will have no real certainty until the  session is over (which now could be as late as October 20).    I will keep you posted as changes and developments occur.  Jeff

I think Scott and Molly (the creative, non-9-5 types) are going to drive together and try to leave before traffic on Friday (i.e., before 2 p.m.).  My guess is that then Colleen and Jeff (the creative-but-not-giving-up-their-day-job types) are going to drive together and leave after traffic. (i.e., after 7 p.m.).  This scenario, however, is all my own deductive reasoning and could easily be WRONG.  I expect we will know more after tonight...

Sid B6 http://www.juancole.com/2012/12/benghazis-criticizes-consular.ht I Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc consulate in 13enghazio Libya dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The "consulate" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city, It was not constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city. I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary, depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for embassy security funds). The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and1/1 e'as the epicenter of the revolution against the government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011. On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel barely avoided death— his car was wired to explode, A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but had defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear, Likely the same shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army officers. There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep Throat. Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail. On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called for back-up. The police car that sped to the scene as ambushed and three policemen in it were killed. Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in custody, with all his valuable testimony. Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then explosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in casualties.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al- Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he was apparently intending to fire at the station. In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their informant go or risk their So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald, a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7 prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police named 6 explicitly: 1 Sufyan Ben Qumu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at Guantanamo 2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the ',Thai& Militia 3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia 4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallala al-Sahati Militia 5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati 6.Salim .Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade It is just a newspaper article. We don't know if the informant actually named these individuals or if he did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over. The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He closed the country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house cleaning to do in Benghazi. U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739848 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: MRT Instruction Letter ;;;   Shemin,  I got the information you requested so that you could revise MRT's permanent release instruction letter.  Time may be of the essence on Monday morning.  Assuming we get the official word on approval from the Creditor Committee early Monday morning, we will need to be in a position to send the revised letter back to MRT late Monday morning.  Basically I begged them to give us until Monday afternoon before the Motion is filed.  Here is the information:  K# 416		Enron Energy Marketing Company 		Termination Date of 10/31/2004 		577 Dth/day MDQ 		Maximum FTS Tariff Rate 		Evergreen and ROFR Rights  K# 434		Enron Energy Services 		Termination Date of 15/31/2004 		3,583 Dth/day MDQ 		Maximum FTS Tariff Rate 		Evergreen and ROFR Rights  MRT has found three counter-parties willing to step into EES's and EEM's contract obligations via permanent capacity releases.  They are National Steel; Village of Dupo, Illinois; and City of Waterloo, Illinois.  With respect to K # 416 and the unusual Enron counter-party name.  EES purchased PG&E Energy Services gas book several years ago.  This MRT transportation contract was a part of that gas book of transactions.  It is probably because of this acquisition that a different EES counter-party was used.  MRT confirms that this contract has a counter=party name of Enron Energy Marketing Company (Duns #941565582).  An effective date of April 1, 2002 for the permanent releases is still everyone's goal.  Thanks,  Ruth Concannon (713) 853-1667 ruth.concannon@enron.com

The Greens have been helping me develop 40 acres of land that I bought just north of Anchor Bay (a couple of miles up the hill from Highway One, about 1200 ft or so up) and they suggested that I contact you.  The property is right in the heart of the Banana Belt and my property faces south, is protected, and a such is very hot and sunny from late spring through later summer/early fall.  The property has an abundance of water on it.  Of course, the possibility of evening fog raises some tricky issues, and I haven't done soil tests.  In short, while I think there are some challenges, I'm convinced that there is at least the strong possibility that I could grow grapes--around 10 acres or so.  I'm sure that you're extremely busy, but I'd be very interested in talking  Best, Jeff

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Update ;;;   Jeff- I was going through my emails when I came across one from you to which I never responded. A few days after you asked if I was working with anthrax, I was whisked to DCv on a charter flight to assist with the investigation there. It was an amazing and intense experience during which I learned a tremendous amount. It was very different being a part of a team, as opposed to directing an investigation. I unfortunately did not have much time to explore DC, although we were staying in a very nice part of Dupont Circle. I am happy to be back in Atlanta (where I have been for only 3 weeks since July). I still have quite a bit of work to complete related to the investigation before letting the rest of the team make their advice, suggestions, and contributions. How have you been? I read briefly that Enron was having some tough times. Did this affect you directly, or were the happenings in another division? Are you going back to Louisville for Thanksgiving or will you be traveling? I will be here in Atlanta, working, and hopefully taking a couple of hours off to enjoy a little turkey nwith friends. The PennAtlanta alumni club will be holding an holiday party in 2 weeks which I hope to attend if I am in town. I know 2 other other Penn-Atlanta couples, so perhaps it will be a good way to reconnect with some people. Does Houston have any similar events? I hope that things are going well for you. I will be an aunt by the time that I will next speak to you!!!! Best, andi

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Direct Access - Potential Cost Savings ;;;   This memo lays out some numbers with regard to the question raised earlier  this week concerning the savings to CDWR if direct access were to be  reinstated.  Using available annual mWh sales figures for PG&E and SCE (1999), commercial  and industrial sales as a percentage of total sales is 63% for PGE and 68%  for SCE, or, in terms of annual mWh purchases, approximately 63,900,000 kWh  for PGE and 61,200,000 kWh for SCE for a total C&I purchase requirement of  125,100,000 kWh.  Assuming that every kWh of C&I load that switches to direct access is an  equivalent reduction in CDWR purchase requirements (which assumes that CDWR  fills 100% of the net short) and bracketing CDWR per unit purchase costs  between its published portfolio cost and an assumed market price of $250 per  kWh, the following cost reductions (stated on a monthly basis) are shown  below:   		Per Month Purchase Cost Reduction Switch to Direct Access	CDWR Portfolio Cost - $79/mWh	Market Price - $250/mWh 5%	$41mm	$130 mm 10%	$ 82 mm	$260 mm 15%	$123 mm	$390 mm 20%	$164 mm	$420 mm  If you have any questions with regard to the above or require further  analysis please advise.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Enron Net Works ;;;   It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will have  a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad  array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major  catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries.   EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, we  have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of over  $25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.  We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very  specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for  transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the  site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and sell  at the posted price.  This converts a &bulletin board8 (the more typical  eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,  competitors that can provide this capability.  We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be  dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are  correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enron.  Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this  opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net  Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a  broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately  be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,  wholesale, retail and broadband services.  Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along  with significant talent and resources in market making and finance.   Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff  services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support  services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and  success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these  new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchant  functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadband.  Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mike  McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial  Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for  Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp.   Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron  North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron,s Executive  Committee.  Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net  Works.  It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as  an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology  Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the  development of worldwide technology standards and platforms.  EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now  be a part of Enron Net Works.  The success of EnronOnLine enables us to  utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets. In addition, the  following individuals are included in Enron Net Works along with their  current eCommerce initiatives: Harry Arora, Public Financial Securities; Jay  Fitzgerald, New Markets Identification; Bruce Garner, Metals; and Greg Piper,  Pulp and Paper.  Over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational  design and will provide full details on this exciting new business  opportunity.

Email Alert  Internet Daily  for Wednesday, January 2, 2002 by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com   Women are majority of eshoppers  An estimated 29 million Internet users bought gifts online  during the holiday shopping season, and 58% of them were women,  according to a nationwide study by the Pew Internet & American  Life Project.  "It's a vote of confidence for the online environment," said Lee  Rainie, the project's director. "It means women think of the  Internet in a much more serious way." Last year, online shoppers  were even split between men and women. For women, a major  attraction of online shopping is its time-saving efficiency,  Rainie said.  AOL Time Warner's AOL found a  trend among its shoppers.  "Overall, females accounted for 64% of all shopping,  underscoring the extent to which AOL's shopping audience is  paralleling offline retailing and making online buying a habit,"  the company said in a release. AOL added its members spent $33  billion online during 2001, an increase of 67% from the prior  year's levels.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Design of long-term contractual mechanism for California ;;;   Is there any detail available about how this long-term contractual mechanism being neogotiated might work? I ask because we have heard about interest in a similar mechanism that was adopted in Australia, in New South Wales. My colleagues in Australia are the main restructuring advisors to the NSW government. Details of this mechanism are in the public domain, i documents available from the NSW Treasury.  If they design it properly it is possible that you could still have some form of retail competition, if the hedge moves with the customer. This was a big design issue in Australia. Otherwise, it looks like a political fudge that will stymie the development of the market for years to come.

I hope you get a chance to go to italy, it is really beautiful and you will enjoy it immensely.

We had a great time, but I'm really looking forward to Hawaii on the way back because we are going to be there for a week and Cassandra is going to join me.  We are heading further west and will participate in some maneuvers in a couple of days.  I can't tell you where because our satellite might be monitered but Cassey knows.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Software License ;;;   Vince & Stinson,  Just wanted to let you know that I had sent this e-mail below to Ms. Geman  last Friday and have not heard back from her.  I'm sure she is very busy -  but just wanted you to know that I am waiting on a response from her.  In the meantime, I did a couple of things:    1.  I checked with Global Strategic Sourcing's attorney just for her input  and opinion on having Ms. Geman's attorney hold the software in escrow and  she said it would depend on whether it was a U.S. attorney and that we would  probably need to get more information on the attorney.  So, I had sent these  questions as listed below on to Ms. Geman.  2.  I checked into the cost of an escrow agreement with a company that  Enron  has previously used for software escrow.  The company is called DSI  Technology and they have different plans depending on our needs.  I briefly  told DSI what we would probably need, and based on your need of having an  agreement with a release condition whereby DSI would release the source code  to Enron under certain conditions, it would have a cost of about $2,400 for  the first year.  This would allow storage space for about 12 CD's.  All three  parties:  DSI, Enron, and D-G Energy would have to sign such agreement.   However, we would have to work out some special details on releasing the  source code because normally DSI will only release if DSI gave them notice  that they could release it or if certain conditions were met (such as D-G  Energy went bankrupt).    I did not send any of this information on to Ms. Geman - I want to see how  she responds first.  However, I wanted to go ahead and let you know this  since it is about $1,400 more than you had said you would be willing to pay.   Do you have any input on this?  Thanks, Karla

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: California Update 5/4/01 ;;;   If you have any questions, please contact Kristin Walsh at (713) 853-9510.  Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is  reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double dip" into  the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.   Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of  contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).    According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.   Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.   Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis.   SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Natsource-Tullet BETA ;;;   Mr. Goldsmith -  I have attached below a copy of the updated BETA reflecting the changes you  proposed earlier. I have added some language to your proposals, but have kept  the intention intact.    The only additional comments that I will make are that Enron will require (a)  a confirmatory letter from Natsource LLC that the LC posted by Natsource will  be applicable to Natsource-Tullet (in essence a guarantee letter) and (b)  if  an LC has already been posted, it will need to be modified so that it will  reflect the ability of Enron to realize under it for Natsource-Tullet.  If no  LC has been issued, this latter point will need to be handled in any LC  issued.  Please take a look at the attached and let me know if anything further.  I  will be checking with our personnel to confirm that Natsource LLC does not  have to be a signatory to this BETA.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Enron-Vitro Amparo ;;;   Attached please find an electronic file containing a memorandum to file I prepared after reviewing materials provided me by Peggy Banczak and Rogelio Lopez-Velarde and following a meeting I had in Washington, D.C. on Monday of this week with Peggy, Rogelio and Lic. Jorge Canals, an Amparo specialist who has been representing Enron's interests in the Amparo proceedings.  As Joe Dilg indicated to you we are not Mexican lawyers and therefore cannot give an opinion on the likelihood that the Mexican Appeals Court will uphold the dismissal of the Enron-Vitro Amparo entered by the District Administrative Court.  Nonetheless, I thought Lics. Lopez-Velade and Canals had a very good understanding of the matter and well-reasoned views concerning the likelihood that the dismissal would be overturned on appeal. As indicated in my memorandum they consider the most likely outcome of the appeal will be confirmation by the Appeals Court of the dismissal entered at the trial court level.  I have known Lic. Lopez-Velarde for many years and consider him a competent thoughtful lawyer.  I met Lic. Canals for the first time Monday and was favorably impressed by him.  He comes highly recommended by Lic. Lopez-Velarde.  The plaintiff in this matter has brought five other almost identical Amparo suits against various energy permit holders.  Four of those suits have been dismissed and their dismissals upheld on appeal.  Dismissals have also been entered by District Administrative Courts in the Enron-Vitro Amparo and the one other Amparo proceeding brought by plaintiff of which Mexican counsel is aware.  Appeals of both those dismissals are pending.  Because of the workings of the Mexican judicial system, the earlier Appeals Courts decisions upholding the dismissals entered by District Administrative Courts of the other four Amparo proceedings brought by the same entity that is the plaintiff in the Enron-Vitro Amparo proceeding have no stare decisis effect, but they do have persuasive value.  I am providing your assistant a copy of this message in the event you do not have access to your E-mail.  Thank you for the opportunity to work on this matter with Peggy and your Mexican counsel.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Hello! ;;;   How is it going?  Did you have a fun weekend?  My weekend was, although  enjoyable,  challenging.  First Eric's wife got sick Friday night and wasn't  able to go out the whole weekend.  Next, my car battery completely died when  I arrived at my friends house in Austin.  I replaced the battery and  everything was fine.  Eric, I,  and my friend proceeded to Maggie Maes to see  the band Pale (the whole point of our trip, right!).  We arrived at Maggie  Maes and asked which level Pale was playing on and were informed they had  cancelled.  Great.  Oh well we had a good time that night anyway.  Cool.    Then, driving back to Houston and coming up upon the Beltway I noticed that  my temp gauge needle was buried deep into the danger zone.  I had to have the  car towed back into downtown.  Anyway, it was an interesting trip.

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.  spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.   Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.   He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming".   Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of  generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This  was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Former Gov. Wilson Criticizes Gov. Davis - Editorial from Sacramento Bee, Sunday June 3, 2001 ;;;   Deregulation not to blame but Davis is: His inaction allowed a problem to  become a power, and fiscal, crisis By Pete Wilson  (Published June 3, 2001)   The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of  hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a  sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand. Five years ago, when  deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature  (and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer,  including then-Lt. Gov. Gray Davis), California enjoyed an excess of supply  over demand amounting to some 30 percent.  Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition; first, to drive  down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and,  second, to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new  generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and  keep in California all the jobs that it would produce.  And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in  applications to build power plants, especially after the effective date of  the legislation in 1998 and the defeat that year by California voters of  Prop. 9 (which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation). The total megawattage  of the filings for 1998 doubled that for 1997. After the effective date  (March 1998) of the deregulation legislation, AB 1890, and the defeat of  Proposition 9 (November 1998), removing the threat of repeal, the total for  1999 was double that of 1998 -- exceeding the 5,000 MW mark in '99 alone.   Just look at the filings for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 in the California  Energy Commission graph (above). Far from causing the problem of energy  shortage, as the Davis administration charges, deregulation caused providers  to file -- by mid-2000 -- applications to build new power plants that  promised to add 10,000 megawatts to California's power supply.  That's why I signed it.  I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB 1890 --  just as I (and every other governor in history) signed other bills which,  though imperfect, promised significant and needed beneficial change from the  status quo, which was certainly true of deregulation.  No one could have anticipated in 1996 the combination of factors -- less  hydroelectric output in the West, warmer summers, sharply higher electricity  demand, constraints on natural gas supply -- that turned an electricity  surplus into an electricity problem by 2000. The reason we will suffer power  blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction  allowed a problem to become a crisis. Now the power crisis threatens to  become a state fiscal crisis.  Governor Davis has been quoted as saying, "If I wanted to raise rates, I  could have solved this problem in 20 minutes." Sadly, by temporizing on  needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis, he  made crisis inevitable. As a result, California bonds have suffered two  downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies, and he has put in jeopardy state  spending for parks, schools, transportation and other capital needs. He has  been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state  budget.  The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in  electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years, which  gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation, or  the curtailment of production of natural gas, which led to price spikes in  recent years. It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting  agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century.  It ignored a 1998 warning by the California Energy Commission of possible  energy shortages by as early as 2000. And when possibility became hard, hot  reality in San Diego in 2000, it continued to ignore it, putting in place a  political, palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem.  Fully a year ago, or earlier had he chosen to do so, Governor Davis could  have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of  California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency, including  explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy. These powers  include the suspension of statute and regulation. It was this power that I  used after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 to rebuild and reopen Los  Angeles' shattered freeways -- just 64 days after their destruction, instead  of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required  by law.  Fully a year ago, Davis could have acted unilaterally, without the  Legislature, to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investor-owned  utilities (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) recently complain of but eagerly requested at  the time of enactment.  He could have, by decree, suspended the provision that prohibited the  utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers.  He could have, by executive order, suspended and truncated the nightmarish  process required by state law for approval of siting. Had he done so early  enough, when he might even have made a difference this summer, and done so  not just with peaker plants but also with large plants, he might have greatly  accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow  us to escape from blackouts, power price spikes and the severe job loss and  economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither  reliable nor affordable.  All these actions, Governor Davis could have taken a year ago -- or earlier:  A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to  prevent it. He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it.  Had the governor heeded the early warnings -- about hot weather, or the  threat of insolvency to the utilities -- and had he acted, using the full  range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have, he could  have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become.  We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast  enough to avoid blackouts this summer.  PG&E would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern  California Edison would not be teetering on the brink.  Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels.  The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers' dollars.  And California's jobs would not be threatened, as they are, by raiders from  other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California  employers to their states and steal our jobs.  The blame game waged by the governor's office adds insult to injury. It will  provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer. But it  does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to  mislead those who are not aware of the real, unhappy facts of California's  present crisis.  The honest explanation for it is simple, not rocket science: State government  cannot ignore the law of supply and demand. It is not the state's  responsibility to build power plants. But it is its responsibility to create  a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers  to do so. Deregulation, even with imperfections that the governor could have  cured by fiat if the need arose, was a significant advance in achieving that  incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest.  The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of  Governor Davis' failure to act. That is the plain, unhappy truth of the  matter. I take no joy in saying so. I have been prepared to be helpful to the  governor during this very serious challenge to our state's well-being, just  as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition  39 (the school bond issue) in the most recent election.  Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him  then, I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and  a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in  order to shift the blame for his own inaction.   Pete Wilson is the former governor of California.   You can see this story at: http://www.sacbee.com/voices/news/voices05.html

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Dow Jones Report ;;;   The Dow Jones report is compiled of data sent from many different  counterparties. The lovely people at Dow Jones painstakingly analyze the data  to ensure its accuracy. Averaged together, these prices become the Dow Jones  daily index price. And that's the long and short of it.   The process, as you've guessed by now, is a little more complicated than  that. For one thing, Dow Jones looks at each counterparty's sales to reach an  average of all the prices. It would be redundant for each counterparty to  ALSO report their purchases from each other. Therefore, when calculating the  Dow Jones data, we only include purchases from counterparties who ARE NOT  participants in the Dow Jones survey. Following is a simple example:  Participant List  NP-15 Purchases  NP-15 Sales  Reported NP-15 Purchases  Reported NP-15 Sales Sempra  Sempra - $250   Sempra - $250  Avista - $270   Sempra - $250 Duke   Duke - $260   Duke - $260      Duke - $260 Enron   Avista - $270   Avista - $270      Avista - $270  Now that's simple!  Following is the participant list for Dow Jones' survey of trading at NP-15  and SP-15 delivery points. Deals with these counterparty names need to be  excluded from the calculation of PURCHASES at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points.  American Electric Power - Amerelecpo Avista Energy - Avistaene Duke Energy Trading and Marketing - Dukeenetra El Paso Merchant Energy Enron Power Marketing, Inc. - EPMI Idaho Power Company - Idacorpene PacifiCorp - PACE Pacific Gas & Electric Company - PG&E Powerex Corp. - PWX Puget Sound Energy, Inc. - PSPL Mirant Americas Energy Marketing (formerly Southern Company Energy Marketing)  - SCEM TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. - Transalt  So I've probably succeeded in confusing you even more, but please feel free  to come bug me with questions.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Commonwealth Club Talk ;;;   Dear Jeff,   I just wanted to let you know that I thought your talk last night was inspirational.    I have been working in the San Francisco office for 2 years helping to permit sites for generating facilities.  During this time our team have had to endure more than our fair share of irrational and misinformed individuals.  One thing they didn't teach me at business school was how to educate people in a hostile and political environment while maintaining your dignity and humility.  Your example last night has certainly set a new personal standard for me to strive for.  Sincerely   Victor Browner

As a  result of amendments to the bylaws that were made in 1994, the duties of the  Chairman of the Board are quite limited.  The bylaws provide that "the  Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and  of the Board of Directors.  The Chairman of the Board shall act as a liaison  between the officers of the Corporation and the Board of Directors."

Walt Zimmerman 	05/04/00 06:49 PM 		  		 To: Michael Burke/Houston/Eott@Eott 		 cc: Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron, Steve Duffy/Houston/Eott@Eott 		 Subject: Annual Election of EOTT Directors and Committees  Prior to the distribution of materials for the May 15 EOTT Board of Directors  meeting, the sole shareholder (Enron Liquids Holding Corp.) needs to reelect  EOTT's Board of Directors.  This will be accomplished by a written consent  that will be executed on behalf of Enron Liquids Holding Corp.  Also, at the May 15 meeting, EOTT's directors will elect the members of the  Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee for the next year.  Are you aware of any changes to the EOTT Board, the Audit Committee, or the  Compensation Committee?  In some past years, Ted Gaylord has polled the  outside directors to ensure that they intended to continue their service on  EOTT's Board and committees.  If you would like, I will ask Ted to poll the  outside directors again this year as to their intentions for continued  service.  Also, we need to start preparing an agenda for the May 15 meeting.  If you  would like, I will forward to you tomorrow a draft agenda that is based on  last year's "annual meeting" agenda.  Please let me know your thoughts on these matters.   Thanks.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Feedback on EOL killed deals process ;;;   Further to recent correspondence on this subject:  "Killing" EnronOnline deals has always been against policy, for a number of  reasons, including the need to demonstrate to customers that this is a  binding way to do deals and also to provide an auditable process to auditors  who may be sceptical of an online transaction system - i.e. we need to show  that clicking on the screen  results in a deal which results in an invoice  every time.  In the same way that it is rare to conclude a transaction by telephone with a  trader and then attempt to "back out", we must ensure it is a rare event on  EnronOnline. Deals can only be terminated under special circumstances, which  must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the legal department in  consultation with Credit and EnronOnline commercial staff and covered with a  special contract entered into with the Counterparty.  In all other circumstances, "undoing" a deal is at the discretion of the  trader and is most easily accomplished by an OTC transaction which reverses  the volume, price and payment impact, thus addressing most of the concerns  raised below.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FW: Changed Punchline ;;;   It's the first day of school in Houston and the teacher thought she'd get  to know the kids by asking them their name and what their father does for a  living.  The first little girl says: "My name is Mary and my daddy is a postman."  The next little boy says: "I'm Andy and my Dad is a mechanic."  Then one little boy says: "My name is Jimmy and my father is a striptease dancer in a cabaret for gay men."  The teacher gasps and quickly changes the subject, but later in the school yard the teacher approaches Jimmy privately and asks if it was really true that his Dad dances nude in a gay bar  He blushed and said, "I'm sorry but my dad is an    	1) auditor for Arthur Andersen  	OR  	2) a trader for Enron    and I was just too embarrassed to say so."

Last night on A&E was a special about Palm Beach, and the good life, charity   balls, social scene, etc.  So I had a Palm Beach Party--bought caviar, fruit   tarts, champagne and sat around watching the show.  I made everyone wear   Lacoste shirts, loafters (no socks) and not put down their glass full of   champagne (as much as possible!)  Fun, casual, and last minute.  For not   being in your biz, I liked the idea and we had fun.       Went to my first exec committee meeting.  Pretty interesting.

I see your max bid says $1600, an obvious mistake that you had to approve unless EBay made a mistake.  For the last time $61 is obviously not out of the price range for those balls this weekend, you won by a dollar.  You can cancel your bid before the auction ends and you did not.  Per the attachment I sent, you have another 5 days to decide to pay or get Ebay to adjust it or I will seek payment through them. PL

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FW: Member Alert #48-2001 - Court of Appeals issues Potential Setbackto SEQRA Generators In NYPA Turbine Ruling ;;;   Attached FYI is a memo prepared by IPPNY summarizing a NY Court of Appeals (NY's highest court) decision issued last week that could impact environmental reviews of projects that are smaller than 80 MW and thus not subject to the State's siting law. As noted by IPPNY, the impact of this court ruling could be to delay the environmental review and thus the permitting time for these smaller plants.  In other generation-related developments, the NYS Siting Board last week approved the Astoria Energy project. This is a 1,000 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle facility to be loacted in Astoria, Queens, New York City. The plant is estimated to go in service the 3rd quarter of 2004. This brings to over 1600 MW the amount of new in-city generation recently approved by the State Siting Board, on top of the 400 Mw\W added this past summer by the NY Power Authority. -----Original Message-----

One idea that we discussed is (i) quickly determine the over-secured portion of the 1.9 Bcf in storage, (ii) allow ENA to sell that gas thereby releasing some of the storage capacity, and (iii) allow Bridgeline to sell the remaining storage capacity (to bring cash in the door and to mitigate the estate's liability) until we decide what to do (i.e. accept or reject).

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Enron Response to October 15 RTO Filings ;;;   In preparation for the upcoming filings from different RTOs around the  country to meet the FERC Order 2000 October 15 deadline, I'd like to outline  a set of steps that we need to undertake to respond appropriately.  Comments  are appreciated.   A few people met with FERC last Friday to discuss our general observations  and what a good RTO will look like (please see attached file below).  Not all RTOs intend to file on October 15.  The filing RTOs (from what I can  tell) include the following: (1) RTO West, (2) Desert Star, (3) SPP, (4)  Entergy, (5) Southern Transco, (6) Grid South, and (7) Florida RTO.  (SPP and  Entergy may file together)  1. Immediate Public Response  It is critical to make sure that we have a list of key issues with each RTO  filing that we can use to make public statements.  Each RTO lead should  prepare  preliminary list of issues and send to Joe Hartsoe and me no later  than Friday.  When the RTO filing is made, we need to review this list and  compare to the actual filings and finalize.  This information will go into  building our public message.    Our initial response will be public (through the trade press).  This will  include making specific comments about each RTO.  Right now we are focusing on (1) failed efforts and (2) insufficient work as  the key problems.  Any details or other topics should be considered.  2. Formal Response to October 15 Filing  Dan Watkiss of B&P will be reviewing the formal filings for details.  Joe  Hartsoe will coordinate our FERC filings due on November 15.  We need these  done by early November to run them through the commercial side.  Each RTO  lead should schedule some time in DC the week of Oct 24 with Joe Hartsoe to  make sure that our filings are on-track and complete.  We should file in each RTO case.  3. E-trans Response  Jeff Brown continues to work to build our model.  No formal plan to roll this  out has been yet developed.  We are working to have something ready by  December 1.  4. Northeast Tight Pool Response  I would like Steve Montovano to take the lead to structure our response.  We  heard at FERC that PJM was considering filing pretty soon (next week).  We  need to get our story straight to take this to a pre-filing meeting at FERC.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Funding Commitments ;;;   To confirm our meeting, in order of timing and/or commitment size priority, we need a summary of the following:  1.  What is the actual amount of the funding commitment, including the amount funded to date?  2.  When is the funding commitment required?  3.  What is the nature of the funding commitment - firm, or non-firm but advisable (and if so why)?  4.  What are the consequences of not funding from a business or project perspective?  5.  What are the consequences of not funding from a legal perspective, including any limited liability/spe protection?  Teresa and I should be able to fill in 5 once we have the answers on 1-4.  Teresa will you please work on outlining 5 in the interim.  Timing obviously depends on when the amounts are required, and the sooner the better.  It would be helpful if we could have something by Thursday evening latest.  Suffice to say, John will not be predisposed to fund these unless he understands the nature of the obligations.  Greatly appreciated.  Peter.

He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.   James Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11.   Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin! Updated 11/23/01 According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen.   Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half.   Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 The Jacksonvil! le! Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.   James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day.   Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain.   Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.   Rod Smith <http://footba! ll! 222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week.   Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.  Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133291&> , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week.   Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1054&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.  David Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=235123&>, RB MIA - Giggles Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of ! a ! disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Reponses to Greenpeace ;;;   Jeff:  I have seen your note to Kate with final proposed letter attached. Thanks  for taking on board some of our suggestions. Let me note however:  1. A typo which we missed before in the last line of second para. - "taken"  should read "undertaken" (you can't "take" an activity!)  2. Disappointment from my point of view that vagueness has crept back into  the third paragraph. (If I am to be designated a spokesman for Enron in  Europe on this issue, even on a restricted, strictly reactive basis, I will  need to know what some of the words and phrases are meant to indicate. The  question of whether or not we support the creation of binding international  commitments entered into by governments has, for instance, been avoided.) The  Q and A will need imaginative crafting to address the lack of clarity in the  letter itself.  Your note implies the original English language text approved is necessarily  the text to be used for all replies, with only local "cover letters". Such an  approach will give local offices of Greenpeace in Europe an impression of a  very US-centric approach. Have you considered the alternative of a local  translation of the full letter, signed by an Enron Europe executive? (I do  not necessarily advocate this approach, but welcome comment also from those  copied.)

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: seeing as mark won't answer my e-mails.... ;;;   Hook us up Ernie.  I would say that we should cap it at around $40, but  obviously $33 would be better.  I agree that $33 would not be a good price to walk. Are you sure?  I just called.  Rate for Sunday morning is $33.  However, Id  id not ask if that was riding or not.  I always assume it means riding butt  hat's because I can't believe anyone would actually want to walk. They do have tee times available in the morning.  Who is going to be playing?  Is there a max $ amount that we want to spend? How many tee times do I need to get?  Is there a certain area in Houston that we want to target?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Company Historian ;;;   Ken,  In my pre-Enron life, I taught history (years and years ago).    Recently, while culling files in preparation for moving from EB to 3AC,  I  came across a pamphlet about the origins of the Transwestern Pipeline Company  and found it very interesting - for the second or third time.  In particular, I am impressed by the vision these pioneers had.  My concern  is that our Enron preserve some record of those early people and days of the  entities that make up the bigger Enron.  They were awesome.  In another pre-Enron segment of my life, I worked for a rare and out-of-print  book dealer.  One of the collections we worked hard to accumulate and then to  sell as a collection was a group of business histories.  The collection was  snapped up the first month we put it on the market.  Great business stories  go on and on being researched by and inspiring new generations of  entrepreneurs.  Not having practiced my craft as historian for many years, I am no longer  familiar with the important names in historical writing (except for popular  historians such as Stephen Ambrose).  If Enron doesn't already have a  historian, we need an established writer of substantial stature - someone  whose produced work would reach a lot of people.    Maybe someone from the Rice University staff could point the way?  Or, maybe  even someone from Rice has the qualities needed to produce an exciting  history of Enron.  Because ours is such a great story, I would like to see a project such as  this pursued.  I would like to know what you think about this suggestion.  Thanks for letting me send this your way.

Bic sending more arms into a society generally — particularly when they are as disorganized and fragmented as they are — will result in more violence — against each other. Boys like to play with guns (trust me as the mother of sons). I am all for saying we have no objection to French doing it to increase pressure on Gaddafi, but in a tribal society where conflicts have been repressed for so long, adding even more weapons does not make sense. Obviously they can get weapons from other places, but nb that they are not awash in weapons now.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Libya ;;;  Secretary Clinton's leadership on Libya HRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group meetings — as well as the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya. She was instrumental in securing the authorization, building the coalition, and tightening the noose around Qadhafi and his regime. February 25— HRC announces the suspension of operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington. February 26 — HRC directs efforts to evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel from Tripoli and orders the closing of the embassy. February 26 -- HRC made a series of calls to her counterparts to help secure passage of UNSC 1970, which imposes sanctions on Gaddafi and his family and refers Qadhafi and his cronies to the ICC February 28 — HRC travels to Geneva, Switzerland for consultations with European partners on Libya. She gives a major address in which she says: "Colonel Qadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for these acts, which violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have lost the legitimacy to govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves clear: It is time for Qadhafi to go — now, without further violence or delay." She also works to secure the suspension of Libya from membership in the Human Rights Council. Early March — HRC appoints Special Envoy Chris Stevens to be the U.S. representative to Benghazi March 14— HRC travels to Paris for the G8 foreign minister's meeting. She meets with INC representative Jibril and consults with her colleagues on further UN Security Council action. She notes that a no-fly zone will not be adequate. B6 B5 March 14-16 — HRC participates in a series of high-level video- and teleconferences She is a leading voice for strong UNSC action and a NATO civilian protection mission. March 17 —HRC secures Russian abstention and Portuguese and African support for UNSC 1973, ensuring that it passes. 1973 authorizes a no-fly zone over Libya and "all necessary measures" - code for military action - to protect civilians against Gaddafi's army. March 19— HRC travels to Paris to meet with European and Arab leaders to prepare for military action to protect civilians. That night, the first U.S. air strikes halt the advance of Gaddafi's forces on Benghazi and target Libya's air defenses. March 24— HRC engages with allies and secures the transition of command and control of the civilian protection mission to NATO. She announces the transition in a statement.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. March 18-30— HRC engages with UAE, Qatar, and Jordan to seek their participation in coalition operations. Over the course of several days, all three devote aircraft to the mission. March 29 — HRC travels to London for a conference on Libya, where she is a driving force behind the creation of a Contact Group comprising 20-plus countries to coordinate efforts to protect civilians and plan for a post-Qadhafi Libya. She is instrumental in setting up a rotating chair system to ensure regional buy-in. April 14 — HRC travels to Berlin for NATO meetings. She is the driving force behind NATO adopting a communiqué that calls for Qadhafi's departure as a political objective, and lays out three clear military objectives: end of attacks and threat of attacks on civilians; the removal of Qadhafi forces from cities they forcibly entered; and the unfettered provision of humanitarian access. May 5— HRC travels to Rome for a Contact Group meeting. The Contact Group establishes a coordination system and a temporary financial mechanism to funnel money to the TNC. June 8 — HRC travels to Abu Dhabi for another Contact Group meeting and holds a series of intense discussions with rebel leaders. June 12 — HRC travels to Addis for consultations and a speech before the African Union, pressing the case for a democratic transition in Libya. Late June — HRC meets with House Democrats and Senate Republicans to persuade them not to de-fund the Libya operation. July 15 — HRC travels to Istanbul and announces that the U.S. recognizes the TNC as the legitimate government of Libya. She also secures recognition from the other members of the Contact Group. July 16— HRC sends Feltman, Cretz, and Chollet to Tunis to meet with Qadhafi envoys "to deliver a clear and firm message that the only way to move forward, is for Qadhafi to step down". Early August — HRC works to construct a $1.5 billion assets package to be approved by the Security Council and sent to the TNC. That package is working through its last hurdles. Early August After military chief Abdel Fattah Younes is killed, S sends a personal message to TNC head Jalil to press for a responsible investigation and a careful and inclusive approach to creating a new executive council. Early August HRC secures written pledges from the TNC to an inclusive, pluralistic democratic transition. She continues to consult with European and Arab colleagues on the evolving situation.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Hello from Houston, Texas ;;;   Amy & Ahmed, 	Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  Thank you for the darling pictures of Khalid.  I'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because I still have one of the "washed in stardust" pic's and of course he's totally changed!  He's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion - and those beautiful, big, brown eyes - what a sweetheart! 	We had a great visit with "PaPaFlo"!  Dad (Cal our Dad) taught Sam to jump (sort of) and now he's unable to just walk anywhere, but has to jump his way where ever he goes (thanks Dad!).  I think PaPaFlo (which now refers to your mom and Dad simultaneaously) got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson.  We went on the slide, "go to swingies", "play-da-cars", "draw-da-picture", "play-da-firetruck", "ride-da-wagon" and "read-da-book" - and I was happy to hear PaPaFlo proceeding each of those phrases rather than Mommy.  Sam is busy! 	I heard Khalid had a cough.  I hope that clears up soon.  I also heard you were looking at a new house.  That's exciting - I'm sure you could use the room.  Good luck with that! 	Tony is on the third week of his new job.  It seems to be going well.  He was bored, but now they gave him two houses in the sheetrock stage to finish.  I hope Ahmed's new job is good too.  Amy, I heard your job was working well from a flexibility standpoint with Khalid.  That is really a blessing. 	I won't mention how my job is going, except I'm still here and we don't know anything you don't know. 	We were sad to hear about Mr. Sutton. 	The kids are all fine.  Missy was disappointed she didn't get to see your mom and Dad while they were here.  She probably thought she might get a present =) 	I need to get out the digital camara and get some new pic's of Sam.  I'll try to get those your way soon.  I'm sure Dad & Flo will have some from their visit too.  Take care! Love, Lindy, Tony, Sam & the kids

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: WSJ:Bold Investors eye Cal Utilities.... ;;;   CC list suppressed...  January 19, 2001 Heard on the Street  Amid California Power Crisis, Investors Bet on Utilities Bonds  By GREGORY ZUCKERMAN and JATHON SAPSFORD Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  As lights go out in California, on Wall Street light bulbs are popping over the heads of investors hoping to profit from the electricity crisis.  Amid the rolling blackouts, investors with a taste for risk are betting on the bonds of the two struggling utilities, units of PG&E Corp. and Edison International, even as they move precariously close to filing for bankruptcy-law protection. The investors are gambling that the companies have enough assets -- and political importance -- that a solution will be found that will include gains for intrepid bondholders.  But some experts advise investors to be careful wading into the energy current, saying it could be a while before the bonds pay off. And they are emphatic that the companies' stocks should be avoided like a downed electrical pole.  Over the past few weeks, the debt of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison has been downgraded to "junk" status by leading rating agencies, and both utilities have missed debt payments -- usually a huge red flag for investors. Meanwhile, holders of the utilities' commercial paper, which is the shortest-term debt, are doing everything they can do to dump their holdings, though it is getting hard to find takers.  But the unsecured, longer-term debt of both companies has remained in demand, trading at around 50 cents on the dollar -- at least 10 cents higher than such debt usually trades at when a company veers so close to a bankruptcy filing. Prices of bonds that are secured by the utilities' plants have actually edged higher in recent weeks, moving from 65 cents on the dollar to about 80 cents -- though the move has come on limited volume.  Behind such movements are aggressive investors such as money manager Martin Whitman, of M.J. Whitman. "We're trying to buy the secured [bonds] like it's going out of style, and some of our smartest clients are buying the unsecured debt," says Mr. Whitman, who runs Third Avenue Value Fund, a mutual fund, as well as hedge funds. Mr. Whitman, whose firm also acts as a broker-dealer for distressed debt, hopes to buy as much as $200 million of the bonds in coming weeks. His only frustration is that the prices aren't coming down.  The number-crunching by investors works along these lines: At current prices for unsecured bonds, investors could score gains of 20% to 25% annually if principal and interest payments are made within the next two to three years, the average bankruptcy-court stay. For secured bonds paid off within that period, the gain would be almost 15% annually. With quicker payoffs, the return jumps, of course. The two utilities have more than $20 billion in debt outstanding, of which just a small fraction is insured.  Why do the bulls -- including distressed-debt specialists as well as funds such as Mr. Whitman's -- see so much value in the utility mess? Unlike the run-of-the-mill troubled company, the utilities are so big, and so important to the California economy, that some form of resolution will likely be found to help them get back on their feet, perhaps by allowing the companies to boost electric rates. Even if a bankruptcy proceeding results, the utilities control sufficient assets to give bondholders a good chance of full recovery of their principal and even eventual payment of any missed interest payments, bulls say.  "They're too big and important not to get a solution," says Todd Thompson, a portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management. "If a theater company or retailer goes away, no one cares, but here there has to be a resolution."  Bond specialists also point to their past home runs betting on debt of troubled utility companies -- such as Public Service of New Hampshire, which was under bankruptcy-court protection in 1988 to 1991 and never missed a bond payment.  "If there's a liquidation, or if they figure this out, you're going to get paid back" principal payments and accrued interest, Mr. Whitman says. Adds Marc Lasry, managing director of Amroc Investments, a leading investor and trader in distressed debt: "There's been quite a lot of buying [because] at the end of the day you'll get paid. The question is how long it will take."  But some caution that the bonds could see weakness in weeks ahead, because some debtholders who want to sell are waiting on the sidelines, hoping to dump their positions, once a resolution becomes more evident. Others caution that the California situation is unlike past utility fiascos where savvy investors made out quite well. The problem in California is a newly deregulated pricing system that has fallen apart, not the overzealous expansion plans that created various earlier problems.  A bankruptcy-court filing would raise further uncertainty, perhaps causing more debt to come up for sale. Creditors fear consumer advocates could lobby against an electric-rate increase that many say is necessary to solve the crisis and cover payments to creditors; these advocates may demand that creditors suffer at least some loss in the value of their holdings. Moreover, resolution of the matter could take much longer than the two to three years that some investors are banking on.  Even as Mr. Whitman and others place their new bets, many investors who months or even years ago bought the utilities' debt, figuring it was rock solid, are licking their wounds. "We stayed away from tobacco. We stayed away from Japanese banks," says Orange Country Treasurer John Moorlach, who invested $40 million in Edison's commercial paper before the credit-ratings agencies downgraded the utilities' debt. With the two California utilities now rated below other investments that Mr. Moorlach wouldn't touch, he says, "It's frustrating."  Mr. Moorlach, as fate would have it, was the man appointed in 1995 to help lift Orange County out of its own financial crisis, one brought on by bad investments. He improved Orange County's finances by prudent investments -- including securities issued by utilities. "This is survivable," he says of his current quandary, "but it's just awkward."  Others say the commercial-paper market is one area where investors could suffer further losses, at least in the near term. One reason: There are few potential buyers for tainted commercial paper, because these short-term securities issued by corporations generally appeal only to ultraconservative investors. Both utilities' commercial paper is being quoted for about 50 cents on the dollar. With little being traded, "it's very hard to get rid of it right now," says Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co., who says those reluctant to bid include Wall Street securities firms.  Things might get worse. While the commercial-paper holders might eventually get at least some of their money back, some fear those payments won't come soon enough to prevent some money-market mutual funds from seeing the value of their shares "break the buck," or drop below the $1-per-share level, causing losses for supposedly sound investments. Such an event, however, would be rare in the money-market world.  As for the utilities' stock, if there is a reorganization of the companies, it could wipe out at least some shareholder value, while bondholders could gain control of the remaining equity. "You're taking huge risks" on the stock, says Mr. Whitman.  PG&E shares have dropped sharply over the past few months, falling from a high of about $30 in late summer. At 4 p.m. Thursday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading they were up 13 cents to $9.75. Edison, meanwhile, was up 13 cents to $9 on the Big Board, down from more than $25 in the summer. Yet, as steep as the declines have been, the shares of both utilities still trade higher than is typical for stocks of companies facing the possibility of bankruptcy.  "The stock price is irrational," Amroc's Mr. Lasry says.  Write to Gregory Zuckerman at gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com and Jathon Sapsford at jathon.sapsford@wsj.com

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Terminations physical and financial ;;;   We just wanted to let you guys know of some changes in order to keep the terminations being processed in a timely manner.  It appears that all Netco employees may be taken off of systems access for Enron this weekend.  In case this is true, Darron and I have transitioned from handling these requests.  Greg Couch is going to be leading the estate risk effort and Pat Ryder and Chance Rabon will be handling all termination list issues.  Please send these lists to these three people in lieu of Darron and I.  As a side note, could you send an updated financial termination list(if this list has changed since you sent it to me Kim) to these guys so that they can verify deals are moved to the proper book.  It is probably a good idea for future termination scripts to come through Greg before going to IT because of several book moves we have made to facilitate reporting to Ed McMichael.  For example the price book has been basically split into three books.  Please shout with any questions or concerns you may have.  Thanks. PL

The trend during 2002 is for a sharp year-on- year drop in demand in the first quarter of 0.7 mbd,, followed by a 1.3 mbd  increase in the fourth quarter as economic recovery sets in.   * Contrasting against this message of very weak oil demand growth is CERA's  outlook for a 1.0 mbd year-on-year gain in non-OPEC supply in 2002.   * As a result, the potential exists for a dramatic oversupply of oil next  year unless OPEC restrains its production. CERA's view is that OPEC continues  to restrain production in late 2001 and 2002 in an attempt to shore up prices.  **end**  Follow above URL for complete report (10 printed pages).

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Grouped Base Privatizations, Western US. ;;;   From discussions with PACAF, USARAK and the NAVFAC Contracting Officers, we  are aware of the following procurements that are intended to be released as a  multi-base effort with a single solicitation.  This supersedes my last  transmission on this subject, because the Navy has just released a new RFI  for a grouped series of bases in California.   1.  Navy, Southwest.     a.  Pt Huneme/Pt Mugu were intended as the first procurement on a bundled  basis, but they are on hold awaiting funding for Phase 2.  They need to do  life cycle cost analysis,  system condition assessment, and inventory.  A  draft RFP will be issued to industry for comment.  The final RFP,  optimistically (according to the NAVFAC SWDiv Commander) could be out as  early as this quarter.  Doug Powell, the Contracting Officer, says a more  realistic date is April-May of 2000.  However, Ralph Torres, the NAVFAC  Business Line Manager for this procurement, is attending a PACFLT meeting  this month in Hawaii to try to hurry this up.    b.  A new RFI has just hit the street, due 15 Nov 99, for electrical, gas,  water, and wastewater privatization at 5 USN locations in Southern  California.  These are Naval Warfare Assessment Station, Corona, CA; Naval  Air Station, Fallon, NV; Naval Air Station, Lemoore, CA; Naval Weapons  Station, Seal Beach, CA (Main Station); and Naval Weapons Station, Seal  Beach, CA (Detachment Fallbrook).       2.  Marines,Southwest.      a.  NAVFAC intends to combine 29 Palms, MCLB Barstow, MCAS Yuma and MCRD  San Diego into one procurement.  We have responded to the RFI, as we have in  the case of the Navy, 1.a, above.  NAVFAC has has funding for Phase 2 for  Barstow and 29 Palms, but not for the other two yet.  The RFP is expected to  hit the street in the April-May, 2000 time frame.    b.  NAVFAC intends to combine Camp Pendleton, a large base in CA, with a  small base used for mountain warfare training at Bridgeport, CA.  The  combination is being made for funding lines and chain of command reasons.   The real plum here is the very large Marine base at Pendleton.  The RFP  is  currently scheduled for release April, 2000, but we think it will be a few  months later to have the above 4-base procurement hit the street first.   3.  Navy, Northwest.  NAVFAC intends to release virtually all their  Northwest activities in a single solicitation.  This includes the following  locations:

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Mother's Day ;;;   Welcome Home!  I hope you had a wonderful trip.  Thank you so much for the thoughtful Mother's Day gift and card.  The pitcher is beautiful and the colors are perfect, as you know!  The shape reminds me very much of one that Mother had at home.  When Janet saw it, the first thing she said was that the shape was reminiscent of earlier days.  I really like it.  Thank you so much!  Dad went out and bought a rose that matched the one on the card almost perfectly.  Unfortunately, the real one only lasted one day before it drooped.  Our trip to MD was quick, but nice.  Our flights were uneventful--the best kind.  Tim and Elena were at National Airport to meet us.  They came on the Metro so we were able to scope that out in case we take it from their house to the airport some morning in the future.  Since Comair has discontinued their Weekender Program, we will have to take regular flights and can go on Fri. night and fly into National.  The Metro doesn't go all the way to Dulles.  Elena has grown 1 1/2 inches since Christmas, according to Sharon.  It wasn't immediately apparent to us, but she does communicate better each time we see her and she amuses herself better this time than when we were there in October.  They are in the process of deciding whether to adopt a baby boy from Russia.  I have about 30 herbs in the back yard waiting to be planted.  I am quite frustrated because I haven't had time to do it.  It is time to put the flowers in as well and I don't have them purchased yet.  The man finished with our deck yesterday so I can put the planters on the deck now too anytime.  This week I wish I weren't working.  This happens to me nearly every year.  There is a big push after May 15 (the frost date) and I can't work fast enough.  I can't exactly put my finger on what I have been doing to take up the time except that there are three birthdays to shop for and two parties for which I at least bake cakes.  Emily's dinner was at their house, Nick's was here last Monday.  He wanted goldenrod eggs, so that was simple.  I hadn't make them in years and years.  One thing that has taken time is Dr. and dentist appointments.  I had my six month dentist checkup and decided that I might as well have a tooth extracted that has been giving me trouble.  The dentist says it can't be saved.  The endodontist was not able to clear out one of the roots because it was calcified, and the root looks questionable.  I have an appointment for the extraction sometime in June.  Then later I will have a bridge put in on that side.  The day after Easter I awoke with my left eyelid drooping more than usual.  It has been quite uncomfortable ever since, some days aching all day.  It doesn't quite interfere with my vision, but is certainly not normal.  I saw our ophthalmologist two weeks ago and a specialist this past week.  He has scheduled a CT scan for Tuesday.  He thinks is it may be a result of the thyroid Graves Disease I had in '99.  The scan is to rule out anything else.  If it is from the thyroid, he says it may eventually correct itself but may take one or two YEARS!   I am grateful these things are not really serious problems.  We learned this week that a good friend from church (our piano tuner) has Alzheimer's Disease.  That was a real shocker.  Did we tell you that our minister is retiring?  He is moving most of his household this weekend.  He isn't leaving till the end of June, but his sons were free this weekend to help him move so Dad arranged for six or seven men to help them load the rental truck yesterday and another man from the church who drives for Krogers, drove the truck to Lancaster, Ohio where they have bought a house.  Dad took a load in our van and helped them unload both van and truck in Lancaster. He had to detour to our car dealer because the sliding door window of the van fell out when he closed it at the parsonage.  They just put it back in with duct tape and referred him to a glass place tomorrow.  Yesterday afternoon I helped prepare, serve, and clean up after a wedding reception at the church.  One of our most active members has been a widow for 30 years.  Her husband died when their children were small and she raised them alone.  She was remarried yesterday to the husband of her cousin who died last year.  I am happy for her.  Each of them has sold their house and together they have bought a cottage at Otterbein Retirement Center in Lebanon--just up the road a piece.  She is 78, I don't know how old he is--comparable I believe.  Dad preached in church today and I played the organ--like old times!  I wish you could have heard our bell choir arrangement of "Dry Bones."  It was amusing and a lot of fun to play.  It almost reminded us of the old Spike Jones Band arrangements.  Dad tied it in with his sermon and the scripture from Elijah.  The new minister that has been assigned to our church is a woman--a first for our church.  That will be interesting.  Her husband is also ordained and will be serving a church in Cleves--the next community down the road from Saylor Park where Eden Chapel is located.  They will be living in our parsonage so he will have quite a commute.  This is a second career for each of them.  She has been serving churches for 12 years.  Well, I really have been rambling on.  I hope you saved this for when you had some time!  You probably had tons of messages waiting for you.  Love, Mother

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants ;;;   The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.  The following guidelines must be followed: ?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants. ?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale.  ?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.   ?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises.  ?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.      If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Credit matrix and 2. Threshold  amount   Jane:  If you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's  view of the CSA/Schedule relationship.  In a nutshell, we provide that a  ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally  a MAC in the CSA).  John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event  triggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate).  I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the  office after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John.   Alternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston  time on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.

Credit matrix and 2. Threshold  amount   Dear John,  Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to  the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly  their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in  place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They  acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards  CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did  say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do  so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are  set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask  them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.  We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you  are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess  this means US$15 million credit limit.    On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract  without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be  able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the  drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?       Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the  "Threshold Amount" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on  this?  Thanks.  Jane McBride     	John Suttle@ECT 	09/27/2000 12:39 AM 		 		 To: Jonathan Whitehead/AP/Enron@ENRON 		 cc: Jane McBride/AP/Enron@Enron, John Viverito/Corp/Enron@Enron, Kevin  Cordesman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Morten E  Pettersen/AP/Enron@Enron, Steven Kleege/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom  Bruce-Jones/LON/ECT@ECT 		 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT  Jonathan,  One thing we might be able to propose is a "Credit Matrix" which prescribes a  Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral  rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each  counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and  they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC)  clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot  automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We  are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates,  the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to  IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is  it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without  using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a  CSA).  Rating (S&P)     Credit Line AA or above    $20MM BBB+ to AA-    $15MM BBB     $10MM BBB-     $7MM BB- to BB+    $5MM Below BB-    $1MM  These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC  clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively  reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with  diminishing credit quality.  What do you all think?  John     Jonathan Whitehead @ ENRON   09/25/2000 08:18 PM

I think it would be an invaluable tool for your group as well as mine in  understanding many of our positions on certain portions of the document. As I  have been meaning to write a guideline to negotiation of the ISDA from the  credit perspective for quite some time, this seems like a perfect opportunity  to make the guidelines more complete. I think it will give us all a better  understanding on why certain things are important as well as perhaps provide  for a more interactive negotiation process between our groups. Let me know  your thoughts.  Thanks, Tanya

The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.  The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol.

This will go on.  Producer prices inflation is falling even faster than CPI inflation.  Moreover, wages remain muted, increasing slower than inflation this year.  With the ongoing weakness of domestic demand all ingredients are thus in  place for further fall in inflation.    * Based on the city CPI, we see Italian prices up 0.2% in November  (possibly only 0.1%), and inflation is likely to lose a further decimal  point at 2.4% (possibly 2.3%). If confirmed, this would be the seventh  consecutive fall in inflation and the lowest level of reached since April  2001.   * We see inflation down in the coming months. The decline in domestic  demand will create more spare capacity, and the fall in commodity prices  will also help. Underlying pressures should thus unwind helping core  inflation down.   * The breakdown suggest that the transportation sector register a large  fall in prices. This is the direct effect of falling oil prices. Despite  the removal of the tax credit on fuel, gasoline prices have indeed  declined. Data also provide some evidence that food prices are also  receding to a more normal level.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FYI ;;;   From today's Electricity Daily re last week's FERC action: ? Commentary: Price Caps Cap Capacity, Not  Prices "We should have learned the lesson by now. Price caps  don't cap prices.  Price caps cap capacity. We've seen that in California this  summer, where,  the investigation by the staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission  demonstrates, price caps had the perverse, and predictable, effect of   driving supply out of the state, pushing up local prices even further. The  same  phenomena cropped up in the 1970s with oil price controls and in the  1980s with  natural gas price controls. FERC's actions last week on the California  electricity "marketplace  meltdown," as Chairman Jim Hoecker put it, were about  right. The major  slippery slope in the FERC California plan is its "price  mitigation"  approach. It is not really a price cap, not even a "soft cap" as  advertised  by some. Under the FERC approach, bids under $150/MWh will work as  before,  with the highest bid setting the market clearing price. But for bids  above  $150, a bidder would get what it bid (if dispatched), but the high bid  would  not set the clearing price for other bidders. So it's not a price cap.  But it's a fiddle, and bidding above the $150 level  would trigger some "market  monitoring" requirements that would give FERC  access to confidential company  data in order to determine whether anybody  was cooking the books. Commissioner  Curt Hebert says he fears that having  the prospect of FERC looking over their  shoulders, and the possibility of  refunds in the future, would scare some  capacity out of the market. He may  be right. More to the point, the whole  thing may be unnecessary. The other steps FERC  is taking are probably sufficient  to kick-start to competitive marketplace.  Particularly salutary are ending the  mandatory buy-sell provision, enabling  forward contracting and hedging, and  fining companies for under-scheduling. Also welcome is FERC's order to the  California Power Exchange and the  California Independent System Operator to shut  down their highly politicized  stakeholder boards and replace them with  independent, business-oriented  directors, including the institution's  management. Nothing has screwed up  the California process more completely than  the board shenanigans,  particularly the political food fights at the ISO board  meetings. As a  journalist, I'm sorry to see them go. But as a businessman and a  devotee of  good public policymaking, I say good riddance. Indeed, FERC should  have gone farther and ordered the merger of the PX and  the ISO. Separating the  two was another case of where California allowed  politics to overcome sound  reason, Californicating the restructuring. Among  other things, the separate  institutions, with separate staff and separate  procedures, drive up transaction  costs. A much sounder model comes in PJM,  where one-stop shopping  prevails. But, taken together and acknowledging that FERC's California action  plan is  only the beginning, I have to give the FERC staff and the commission  high  marks. Unfortunately, in typical FERC fashion, they have managed to launch  a  major undertaking during the coming holiday season. Coal in the stockings  for  that one, folks."

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: Testing PSW and Path confirmation for Target date 6/20 ;;;   Cara et all,   	Following list of bug fixes are moving out to stage to address the recently reported issues:   	New versions of both applications have been moved out to stage..   PreSchedule Workspace: #1 Problem: Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message)  This is showing Physical and non-physical right.  Solution: Line 69 , the timezone value under column G was '6/20/2001-6/20/2001' when it should have been 'PDT' or any other valid timezone value.   #2 Problem: Running Build Route Report: 	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got "List index out of bounds (4)" error *needs fix  Solution: Fixed.. was losing track of which workspace was open  #3 Problem: Daily Summary Function *needs fix or workaround-Would not work at all, got 3 error messages. " Unable to locate" "can't find last row!", and "Failed to export summary!" this is going to create a csv file right to the AGG sched vol report now according to Mr. Poston, I am thrilled to hear it.  Solution: Executive Report was just pushed to stage yesterday, the data is currently what we're focusing on with this release and will soon start shaping it to make it visualy look like the pre-existing excel-based Executive Report.  #4 Problem: Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted 	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states "ERROR:" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix  Solution: Error Checking will not spit out any errors if there aren't any.    Path Confirmation:   #1 Problem: One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?  Solution: Dialog box included for deletion alert confirmation purposes and button repositioned.       thanks Asem x31700                 PreSchedule Workspace:  Running Build Route Report: 	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got "List index out of bounds (4)" error *needs fix 	 Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted 	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states "ERROR:" no reason.

All are coming through as Non-Physical.  This is must be fixed prior to release for production as our WSCC fee pulls directly from this data in deal Scheduling.   Path Confirmation:  Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the "ok" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus. Confriming 2 paths with the 20th fully populated took 1:39.  Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.  One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?  All of the sorting looks great, the paths are represented properly, we are very very close!   Real Time Discussion:  Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.  Here are the sheets that I have used to create data for 6/20   << File: COB_JUNE20_USEME.psc >>  << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >>  << File: Palo_June20.psc >>  << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >>   I can do more testing or Net meeting stuff tomorrow until about 10:30, but after that I have to be a scheduler for a couple of hours.

Basically, we believe that Japanese corporations can enter into the  Master Bandwidth Purchase and Sale Agreement.       A.  There is no specific internal authorization required in Japanese  corporate law and practice, unless the transaction is considered  "important."  Obviously, the question of what is "important" is relative.       B.  Generally, larger companies have internal directors' rules that  specify a monetary amount above which transactions must be subject to board  approval.  Outsiders are usually not privy to that information and, having no  notice thereof, are not prejudiced by failure of the company to follow its  own internal approval procedures.  There is case law to support that notion  with regard to the claims of innocent contract counter parties.       C.  However, if the counter party has notice that board approval is  required, but has not been obtained, or the counter party is "negligent"  (like a constructive notice type of situation) the counter party will not  have the benefit of any lack of authority argument or defense.       D.  We note that the draft Master Agreement provides a representation  and warranty regarding due authorization in Section 10.(a)(iv).  Although not  determinative, this provision should be considered by a Japanese court.       E.  As the execution of the Master Agreement does not involve a specific  transaction and transaction amount, it is unlikely that it would fall into  this "important" matter category requiring board approval.  However, the  transactions will have to be judged on a case-by-case basis.  2.  A.  In the BWT context, if the bandwidth purchaser is not going to use  the bandwidth itself (i.e., the purchaser plans to re-sell the bandwidth),  the purchaser will have to be licensed as a telecommunications carrier under  the Telecommunications Business Law of Japan (the "TBL").       B.  In order to be licensed as a telecommunications carrier, the general  rule is that the registered business purpose of the corporation must specify  that its business purpose is to carry on telecommunications business.   (Please see the corporate register of the Applications YK and Network YK for  examples of this.)  We note that the draft Master Agreement provides a  representation and warranty regarding licensing in Section 10.(a)(iii).       C.  Basically, a violation of the licensing requirement should not  affect the validity of the contract, but simply result in the bandwidth  trader becoming subject to the penal provisions of the TBL.  However, one  should keep in mind that the intention of the TBL is to protect the public  good and, to the extent that disregard of its licensing requirements in  connection with BWT might be considered a threat to or undermining of the  integrity of the telecommunications system, broader regulatory action may be  a possibility.  In that regard, an action for specific performance of a  bandwidth delivery obligation by the unlicensed trader may be problematic.   We hope this answers your initial question.  Best regards.  Jeff Jeff,  Here is the latest version of the Master Agreement.  The scope of the review at this time is limited to whether Japanese companies are authorized to enter into such an agreement.  I will let you know when or if the traders are interested in having the form reviewed from a Japanese law perspective.   Please let me or Cynthia know if you have any questions or comments.

As a side note, John Singer sent a list of various "behind the citygate"  deals--I took his list and tried to match them with what CES sent to  us--there were quite a few discrepancies on prices, etc.  I'll bring this  list to you later so that you can try to match them up with your lists of  deals.  Although I don't think the dollar impact will be that much since  these are all small volumes, I want to be sure we had the right information  on the deals to begin with.

I talked this over with Vince and he has decided that the Research Group will be allowed two (2) personal days per year to take care of personal business and not have to take a vacation day, discretionary day, or leave of absence.  If you have advance notice (such as an air conditioner repair scheduled), please let me know when you are going to take these days.  If an  emergency arises with no notice, please call in and let me know that you  are taking a personal day.  It will be coded on your time sheet.  These two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of, "funeral  leave", "family leave", or "civic duty leave".  They are just a way of being  able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise.   These should be very beneficial and I am sure very much appreciated by  all of us.  If you have any questions, please call me.  Shirley 3-5290

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Public Utility District No. 1 of Clark County, Washington ;;;   Jay,  To reconfirm my conversation yesterday with Reid Grossman, a consultant hired  by the referenced counterparty to negotiate their trading documents with us:  1.  PUD #1 would also like to get gas and power trading agreements in place  with us.  Per my conversation with Dave Fuller yesterday, the physical  trading agreements are of a higher priority than the financial trading  agreement. 2.  They would like to get a draft of a collateral annex from us.  Their  suggested trading threshold for themselves was in the $3.5-5mm range. 3.  They would already be in default of the MAC's you sent me in the credit  worksheet dated 1/25/01.  We need to revisit the MACs. 4.  They think a 3rd party debt threshold of $1mm is too low for them, they  suggested a threshold of $10mm. 5.  The agreement provides for annual and quarterly financial statements.  I  don't think they have quarterly.  You need talk to them about what they  can/will provide.  If you would like to talk to Reid directly, his ph no. is 509/252-5096.  By the way, Reid is an old buddy of Bill Bradford from Reid's Avista/PG&E  days, and Reid sends his regards to Bill.  If you see Bill pass this message  on...

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales ;;;   Katie Ewig 1160 Ogden St. 207 Denver, CO 80218 kmewig@yahoo.com  To Mr. Ken Lay,  I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.  Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.  The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.  Sincerely,  Katie Ewig

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FERC ruling on Kern expansion ;;;   Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action  FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River  Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the  natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were  happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved.  "The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is  something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort," but the  "precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword," warned  Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although  she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC  "should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action."  Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action  expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the  "extraordinary regulatory treatment" that the Commission gave it. Critics  claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler  Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she  noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas.  "...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in  the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how  our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing  electric generation in California this summer," Breathitt said. If anything,  she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even  worse than it is.  There should have been a "fuller airing of this issue" at FERC before the  project was certificated, she noted. "It would be counterproductive for this  Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without  ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more  importantly, that they will cause no further harm."  The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas  and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers,  that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing  customers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over  expansion shippers.  "We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative  impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines," the order said  [CP01-106. For starters, "the record does not show that pro-rata allocations  of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge." Kern River  reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at  Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result  of this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the  Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598  MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave  Pipeline shippers, it noted.  "Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be  greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes.  The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes  attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to  Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide  sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers," the order said.  "The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at  Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing  the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation  path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction."  The project would increase the "limited-term, incremental transportation  capacity" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help  address the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900  horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor  stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and  an existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has  a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year.  Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the  project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced  by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending  at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of  the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects. The 2003 project  recently went through an open season

The energy is  unit contingent power  at the WWP system. I have placed copies of the tags  and oasis requests in the Services Books.   I have purchased PacifiCorp Firm transmission to move from the Willamette  Busbar to the BPA system interconnect. Then Snohomish network transmission to  move from PacifiCorp's system to Avista's system.  I have requested that Willamette give Enron a phone number to allow us to  communicate Real Time with their generation staff. I will pass this along  when it's received.   Although the schedule is unit contingent I would like to make a reasonable  effort to keep the schedule whole when Willamette has unit problems. If we  can show that this energy is a reasonably reliable energy source it will open  up future opportunities. If there are curtailments call Pac Transmission at  503-251-5230, Snohomish Transmission at 425-304-1620 and WWP at 509-495-8534  and inform them of the cut and whatever resupply source that maybe used.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: AP - Rice defends Benghazi remarks ;;;  AP - Rice defends Benghazi remarks By: Associated Press November 21, 2012 07:03 PM EST U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Wednesday her early account of the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans in Benghazi was based on the initial intelligence community assessments and was always subject to review and updates. She said she respected Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has been critical of her, but said "some of the statements he's made about me have been unfounded, but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discuss all of this with him." Her comments attributed the attacks to a mob enraged over an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube were widely denounced by Republicans during the U.S. presidential campaign. The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States, and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place on the anniversary. The focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President Barack Obama's first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not expected to stay on during his second term. Rice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: "As a senior U.S. diplomat, I agreed to a White House request to appear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day, which at that time were primarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities, American diplomatic facilities around the world, and Iran's nuclear program." Hours before the Benghazi violence, a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti- Islamic blasphemy. Killed in the Benghazi violence were Ambassador Chris Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith and two former Navy SEALs, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. Rice said, "The attack on our facilities in Benghazi was obviously a significant piece of this" pattern. "When discussing he attack against our facilities in Benghazi, I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to me by the intelligence community," she said. "I made clear that the information was preliminary, and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers," she added.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: TDS Valuation Enhancement Authorization Requested ;;;   The TDS IT group needs your approval to start work on some enhancements to the TDS Deal Ticker.  TDS currently is not valuing physical changed deals correctly.                              Change deal valuation is based on current value vs the value from the previous night port calc.   However since CPR numbers can change                           when the deal is revised, it does not have a exact previous valuation to compare to. Resulting in full deal value displaying as the change.                           Bill has a concept to base Change Deal Value on the whole Sitara deal rather than the individual CPR tickets.  TDS does not value correctly deals priced to the desk at Mid                            Current valuation does not take physical premium into effect.  Not a large value effect unless the physical premium is large,                           such as IF-NGPL/Harper, that has a premium of $.22.                           The CPR reader can be changed to include the Mid Market Flag that CPR has.  Valuation can then include premium into the calc.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: On-line Bandwidth Derivatives ;;;   Tom:  I saw this on the Internet today:    ARBINET COMMUNICATIONS INTRODUCES ON-LINE  TRADING OF BANDWIDTH DERIVATIVES BUSINESS  EDITORS/TECHNOLOGY WRITERS SAN  DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MAY 11, 1999--ARBINET  COMMUNICATIONS, INC., THE WORLD'S   [Business Wire ? Rcvd: May 11, 08:08 AM EDT ]     BW0167 MAY 11,1999 5:09 PACIFIC 8:09 EASTERN   ( BW)(CA-ARBINET-COMMUNICATIONS) Arbinet Communications Introduces On-Line  Trading of Bandwidth Derivatives   Business Editors/Technology Writers   SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 11, 1999--Arbinet Communications, Inc., the  world's leading trading network for telecommunications capacity, will inaugurate Internet trading of forwards and  options in telecommunications bandwidth later this month.   Trading in the bandwidth derivatives is being facilitated through Arbinet's  access-controlled website where buyers and sellers can post prices anonymously. Execution occurs offline, subject to a screening  process for credit, documentation and interoperability issues. The announcement was made at the TRA Conference,  Booth No. 1004.   As a second phase of the project, Arbinet is developing a physically settled  derivative product that will allow anonymous web-based execution, culminating in delivery to Arbinet switching hubs.  Implementation of this product is an extension of Arbinet's physically settled minutes trading system, the Arbinet Global  Clearing Network(TM) (AGCN(TM)).   Forward and option derivative trading in bandwidth provides distinct  advantages for clients who wish to hedge their exposure to future moves in the price of capacity. Furthermore, it provides a level  playing field where even small operators can realize the pricing advantages which were, until recently, available only to large  incumbent telecommunications carriers. Buyers and sellers can manage risk allowing them to better plan for the future.   Sellers of the forward contract can be natural suppliers of capacity such as  submarine cable operators. Buyers can be natural consumers (e.g. Internet Service Providers and Competitive Local Exchange  Carriers) or speculators.   "Arbinet aims to be the premier provider of risk-management solutions for the  bandwidth market," said U. Kanad Chakrabarti, vice president of Bandwidth Trading, Arbinet. "As a non-proprietary player,  we can offer impartial execution for our clients, which is important in a non-transparent and illiquid market like this."   All bandwidth contracts will be posted on Arbinet's bandwidth trading site,  www.ebandwidth.net, beginning May 21, 1999. The forward contract allows buyers and sellers to reserve transmission  capacity. The option contract allows buyers and sellers to realize the optionality value present in the bandwidth market, but  currently not fully priced by telecommunications players.   "We provide customers with a service not offered by any other on-line trading  company," said Alex Mashinsky, chairman and founder, Arbinet. "Of key importance, we don't trade for ourselves, which  gives us complete objectivity in trade execution.   "This new service is a natural outgrowth of our experience in trading telecom  minutes on behalf of international and multinational telecommunications carriers."   For more information, contact U. Kanad Chakrabarti at (212) 230-1200 or via  e-mail at kchakrabarti@arbinet.com.   Arbinet (www.arbinet.com) is the world's leading Internet trading exchange  and switch-based clearing network for global telecommunications capacity. Arbinet routed over 174 million minutes for  international carriers in 1998, which it estimates represented over 80% of all exchange-traded minutes traffic for that year.  The Arbinet Global Clearing Network is presently clearing and settling minutes for all types of communications companies  including Internet Telephony Service Providers and major carriers. Founded in 1994, the company has 52 employees and is  headquartered in New York with offices in Tokyo, Sao Paulo, and Hong Kong. AGCN was recently awarded Internet Telephony  magazine's prestigious Editor's Choice Award for 1999.   Arbinet Global Clearing Network and AGCN are trademarks of Arbinet  Communications, Inc.
